Then on the table there \nwere a bunch of roses, a plant, and some peonies, and more \narrived during the day. \n\nI got masses of things from Mummy and Daddy, and was \nthoroughly spoiled by various friends. Among other things I \nwas given Camera Obscura , a party game, lots of sweets, \nchocolates, a puzzle, a brooch, Tales and Legends of the \nNetherlands by Joseph Cohen, Daisy’s Mountain Holiday (a \nterrific book), and some money. Now I can buy The Myths \nof Greece and Rome— grand! \n\nThen Lies called for me and we went to school.

        "original_text": "Saturday, 20 June, 1942 \n\nI haven’t written for a few days, because I wanted first of \nall to think about my diary. It’s an odd idea for someone like \nme to keep a diary; not only because I have never done so \nbefore, but because it seems to me that neither I-nor for \nthat matter anyone else— will be interested in the unbosom- \nings of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl. Still, what does that mat- \nter? I want to write, but more than that, I want to bring out \nall kinds of things that lie buried deep in my heart. \n\nThere is a saying that ‘paper is more patient than man”; \nit came back to me on one of my slightly melancholy days, \nwhile I sat chin in hand, feeling too bored and limp even to \nmake up my mind whether to go out or stay at home. Yes, \nthere is no doubt that paper is patient and as I don’t intend \nto show this cardboard-covered notebook, bearing the proud \nname of “diary,” to anyone, unless I find a real friend, boy or \ngirl, probably nobody cares. And now I come to the root of \nthe matter, the reason for my starting a diary: it is that I have \nno such real friend. \n\nLet me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a \ngirl of thirteen feels herself quite alone in the world, nor is it \nsq. I have darling parents and a sister of sixteen. I know about \nthirty people whom one might call friends-I have strings of \nboy friends, anxious to catch a glimpse of me and who, failing \nthat, peep at me through mirrors in class. I have relations, \naunts and uncles, who are darlings too, a good home, no— I \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n3 \n\n\ndon’t seem to lack anything. But it’s the same with all my \nfriends, just fun and joking, nothing more. I can never bring \nmyself to talk of anything outside the common round. We \ndon’t seem to be able to get any closer, that is the root of the \ntrouble. Perhaps I lack confidence, but anyway, there it is, a \nstubborn fact and I don’t seem to be able to do anything \nabout it. \n\nHence, this diary. In order to enhance in my mind’s eye the \npicture of the friend for whom I have waited so long, I don’t \nwant to set down a series of bald facts in a diary like most \npeople do, but I want this diary itself to be my friend, and I \nshall call my friend Kitty. No one will grasp what I’m talking \nabout if I begin my letters to Kitty just out of the blue, so \nalbeit unwillingly, I will start by sketching in brief the story \nof my life. \n\nMy father was thirty-six when he married my mother, who \nwas then twenty-five. My sister Margot was born in 1926 in \nFrankfort-on-Main, I followed on June 12, 1929, and, as we \nare Jewish, we emigrated to Holland in 1933, where my father \nwas appomted Managing Director of Travies N.V. This firm \nis in close relationship with the firm of Kolen & Co. in the \nsame building, of which my father is a partner. \n\nThe rest of our family, however, felt the full impact of \nHitler’s anti-Jewish laws, so life was filled with anxiety. In \n1938 after the pogroms, my two uncles (my mothers \nbrothers) escaped to the U.S.A. My old grandmother came \nto us, she was then seventy-three. After May 1940 good times \nrapidly fled: first the war, then the capitulation, followed by \nthe arrival of the Germans, which is when the sufferings of us \nJews really began. Anti-Jewish decrees followed each other in \nquick succession. Jews must wear a yellow star, 1 Jews must \nhand in their bicycles, Jews are banned from trains and are \nforbidden to drive. Jews are only allowed to do their shopping \nbetween three and five o’clock and then only in shops which \nbear the placard “Jewish shop.” Jews must be indoors by eight \no’clock and cannot even sit in their own gardens after that \n\n’■To distinguish them fiom otheis, all Jews were forced by the Germans to \nwear, prominently displayed, a yellow six-pointed star. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n4 \n\n\nhour. Jews are forbidden to visit theaters, cinemas, and other \nplaces of entertainment. Jews may not take part in public \nsports. Swimming baths, tennis courts, hockey fields, and \nother sports grounds are all prohibited to them. Jews may not \nvisit Christians. Jews must go to Jewish schools, and many \nmore restrictions of a similar kind. \n\nSo we could not do this and were forbidden to do that. But \nlife went on in spite of it all. Jopie used to say to me, \"You’re \nscared to do anything, because it may be forbidden.\" Our \nfreedom was strictly limited. Yet things were still bearable. \n\nGranny died in January 1942; no one will ever know how \nmuch she is present in my thoughts and how much I love her \nstill. \n\nIn 1934 I went to school at the Montessori Kindergarten \nand continued there. It was at the end of the school year, I \nwas in form 6B, when I had to say good-by to Mrs. K. We \nboth wept, it was very sad. In 1941 I went, with my sister \nMargot, to the Jewish Secondary School, she into the fourth \nform and I into the first. \n\nSo far everything is all right with the four of us and here I \ncome to the present day.",

We’ve given up scrounging for extra pocket \nmoney. Oasis is usually full and among our large circle of \nfriends we always manage to find some kindhearted gentle- \nman or boy friend, who presents us with more ice cream than \nwe could devour m a week. \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n5 \n\n\nI expect you will be rather surprised at the fact that I \nshould talk of boy friends at my age. Alas, one simply cant \nseem to avoid it at our school As soon as a boy asks if he may \nbicycle home with me and we get into conversation, nine out \nof ten times I can be sure that he will fall head over heels in \nlove immediately and simply won t allow me out of his sight. \nAfter a while it cools down of course, especially as I take little \nnotice of ardent looks and pedal blithely on. \n\nIf it gets so far that they begin about “asking Father” I \nswerve slightly on my bicycle, my satchel falls, the young man \nis bound to get off and hand it to me, by which time I have \nintroduced a new topic of conversation. \n\nThese are the most innocent types; you get some who blow \nkisses or try to get hold of your arm, but then they are defi- \nnitely knocking at the wrong door. I get off my bicycle and \nrefuse to go further m their company, or I pretend to be in- \nsulted and tell them in no uncertain terms to clear off. \n\nThere, the foundation of our friendship is laid, till tomor- \nrowl \n\nYours, Anne",

They won t have a florin left for the holidays, \nit will all be gone on betting. “You’ll move up,” “Shan’t,” \n“Shall,” from morning till night. Even Miep pleads for silence \nand my angry outbursts don’t calm them. \n\nAccording to me, a quarter of the class should stay where \nthey are; there are some absolute cuckoos, but teachers are \nthe greatest freaks on earth, so perhaps they will he freakish \nin the right way for once. \n\nI’m not afraid about my girl friends and myself, we’ll \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n6 \n\n\nsqueeze through somehow, though fro not too certain about \nmy math. Still we can but wait patiently. Till then, we cheer \neach other along. \n\nI get along quite well with all my teachers, nine in all, \nseven masters and two mistresses. Mr. Keptor, the old math \nmaster, was very annoyed with me for a long time because I \nchatter so much. So I had to write a composition with “A Chat- \nterbox” as the subject. A chatterbox! Whatever could one \nwrite? However, deciding I would puzzle that out later, I \nwrote it in my notebook, and tried to keep quiet. \n\nThat evening, when Td finished my other homework, my \neyes fell on the title in my notebook. I pondered, while chew- \ning the end of my fountain pen, that anyone can scribble some \nnonsense in large letters with the words well spaced but the \ndifficulty was to prove beyond doubt the necessity of talking. \nI thought and thought and then, suddenly having an idea, \nfilled my three allotted sides and felt completely satisfied. My \narguments were that talking is a feminine characteristic and \nthat I would do my best to keep it under control, but I should \nnever be cured, for my mother talked as much as I, probably \nmore, and what can one do about inherited qualities? Mr. \nKeptor had to laugh at my arguments, but when I continued \nto hold forth in the next lesson, another composition followed. \nThis time it was ‘Incurable Chatterbox,” I handed this in and \nKeptor made no complaints for two whole lessons. But in the \nthird lesson it was too much for him again. “Anne, as punish- \nment for talking, will do a composition entitled ‘Quack, quack, \nquack, says Mrs. Natterbeak.’ ” Shouts of laughter from the \nclass. I had to laugh too, although I felt that my inventiveness \non this subject was exhausted. I had to think of something \nelse, something entirely original. I was in luck, as my friend \nSanne writes good poetry and offered to help by doing the \nwhole composition in verse. I jumped for joy. Keptor wanted \nto make a fool of me with this absurd theme, I would get my \nown back and make him the laughing-stock of the whole class \nThe poem was finished and was perfect. It was about a mother \nduck and a father swan who had three baby ducklings. The \nbaby ducklings were bitten to death by Father because they \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n7 \n\n\nchattered too much. Luckily Keptor saw the joke, he read the \npoem out loud to the class, with comments, and also to vari- \nous other classes. \n\nSince then I am allowed to talk, never get extra work, in \nfact Keptor always jokes about it. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Tuesday , SO June, 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nIve not had a moment to write to you until today. I was \nwith friends all day on Thursday. On Friday we had visitors, \nand so it went on until today. Harry and I have got to know \neach other well in a week, and he has told me a lot about his \nlife; he came to Holland alone, and is living with his grand* \nparents. His parents are in Belgium. \n\nHarry had a girl friend called Fanny. I know her too, a very \nsoft, dull creature. Now that he has met me, he reahzes that \nhe was just daydreaming in Fanny's presence. I seem to act \nas a stimulant to keep him awake. You see we all have our \nuses, and queer ones too at times! \n\nJopie slept here on Saturday night, but she went to Lies on \nSunday and I was bored stiff. Harry was to have come in the \nevening, but he rang up at 6 p.m. I went to the telephone, he \nsaid, “Harry Goldberg here, please may I speak to Anne?” \n“Yes, Harry, Anne speaking.” \n\n“Hullo, Anne, how are you?” \n\n“Very well, thank you.” \n\nTm terribly sorry I can’t come this evening, but I would \nlike to just speak to you; is it all right if I come in ten min- \nutes?” \n\n“Yes, that’s fine, good-by!” \n\n“Good-by, 111 be with you soon.” \n\nReceiver down. \n\nI quickly changed into another frock and smartened up my \nhair a bit. Then I stood nervously at the window watching for \nhim. At last I saw him coming. It was a wonder I didn’t dash \ndown at once; instead I waited patiently until he rang. Then I \nwent down and he positively burst in when I opened the door. \n“Anne, my grandmother thinks you are too young to go out \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\nregularly with me, and that I should go to the Leurs, but per- \nhaps you know that I am not going out with Fanny any morel\" \n\n“No, why is that, have you quarreled?\" \n\n“No, not at all. I told Fanny that we didn't get on well to- \ngether, so it was better for us not to go out together any more, \nbut she was always welcome in our home, and I hope I should \nbe in hers. You see, I thought Fanny had been going out with \nanother boy and treated her accordingly. Rut that was quite \nuntrue. And now my uncle says I should apologize to Fanny, \nbut of course I didn't want to do that so I finished the whole \naffair. That was just one of the many reasons. My grandmother \nwould rather I went with Fanny than you, but I shan't; old \npeople have such terribly old-fashioned ideas at times, but I \njust can't fall into line. I need my grandparents, but in a sense \nthey need me too. From now on I shall be free on Wednesday \nevenings. Officially I go to wood-carving lessons to please my \ngrandparents, in actual fact I go to a meeting of the Zionist \nMovement. I’m not supposed to, because my grandparents are \nvery much against the Zionists. I’m by no means a fanatic, but \nI have a leaning that way and find it interesting. But lately it \nhas become such a mess there that I'm going to quit, so next \nWednesday will be my last time. Then I shall be able to see \nyou on Wednesday evenings, Saturday afternoon, Sunday aft- \nernoon, and perhaps more.\" \n\n“But your grandparents are against it, you can’t do it be- \nhind their backs!” \n\n“Love finds a way.” \n\nThen we passed the bookshop on the comer, and there \nstood Peter Wessel with two other boys; he said “Hello\"— it's \nthe first time he has spoken to me for ages, I was really \npleased. \n\nHarry and I walked on and on and the end of it all was that \nI should meet him at five minutes to seven m the front of his \nhouse next evening. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n10",

        "original_text": "Friday , S July , 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nHarry visited us yesterday to meet my parents, I had bought \na cream cake, sweets, tea, and fancy biscuits, quite a spread, \nbut neither Harry nor I felt like sitting stiffly side by side in- \ndefinitely, so we went for a walk, and it was already ten past \neight when he brought me home. Daddy was very cross, and \nthought it was very wrong of me because it is dangerous for \nJews to be out after eight o’clock, and I had to promise to be \nin by ten to eight in future. \n\nTomorrow I’ve been invited to his house. My girl friend \nJopie teases me the whole time about Harry. I’m honestly not \nin love, oh, no, I can surely have boy friends—no one thinks \nanything of that— but one boy friend, or beau, as Mother calls \nhim, seems to be quite different. \n\nHarry went to see Eva one evening and she told me that \nshe asked him, “Who do you like best, Fanny or Anne?” He \nsaid, “It’s nothing to do with you!” But when he left (they \nhadn’t chatted together any more the whole evening), “Now \nlisten, it’s Anne, so long, and don’t tell a soul.” And like a \nflash he was gone. \n\nIt’s easy to see that Harry is in love with me, rather fun for \na change. Margot would say, “Harry is a decent lad.” I agree, \nbut he is more than that. Mummy is full of praise* a good- \nlooking boy, a well-behaved, nice boy. I’m glad that the whole \nfamily approve of him. He likes them too, but he thinks my \ngirl friends are very childish, and he’s quite right. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nSunday morning, 5 July, 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nOur examination results were announced in the Jewish \nTheater last Friday. I couldn’t have hoped for better. My re- \nport is not at all bad, I had one wx satis, a five for algebra, \ntwo sixes, and the rest were all sevens or eights. They were \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n11 \n\n\ncertainly pleased at home, although over the question of \nmarks my parents are quite different from most They don't \ncare a bit whether my reports are good or bad as long as Im \nwell and happy, and not too cheeky: then the rest will come \nby itself. I am just the opposite. I don’t want to be a bad \npupil; I should really have stayed in the seventh form in the \nMontessori School, but was accepted for the Jewish Second- \nary. When all the Jewish children had to go to Jewish schools, \nthe headmaster took Lies and me conditionally after a bit of \npersuasion. He relied on us to do our best and I don’t want \nto let him down. My sister Margot has her report too, brilliant \nas usual. She would move up with cum laude if that existed \nat school, she is so brainy. Daddy has been at home a lot \nlately, as there is nothing for him to do at business; it must \nbe rotten to feel so superfluous. Mr. Koophuis has taken over \nTravies and Mr. Kraier the firm Kolen & Co. When w© \nwalked across our little square together a few days ago, \nDaddy began to talk of us going into hiding. I asked him why \non earth he was beginning to talk of that already. “Yes, \nAnne,” he said, ‘you know that we have been taking food, \nclothes, furniture to other people for more than a year now. \nWe don’t want our belongings to be seized by the Germans, \nbut we certainly don’t want to fall into their clutches our- \nselves. So we shall disappear of our own accord and not wait \nuntil they come and fetch us.” \n\n“But, Daddy, when would it be?” He spoke so seriously \nthat I grew very anxious. \n\n“Don’t you worry about it, we shall arrange everything. \nMake the most of your carefree young life while you can.” \nThat was all. Oh, may the fulfillment of these somber words \nremain far distant yet! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Wednesday, 8 July, 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nYears seem to have passed between Sunday and now. So \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n12 \n\n\nmuch has happened, it is just as if the whole world had \nturned upside down. But I am still alive, Kitty, and that is the \nmain thing, Daddy says. \n\nYes, I'm still alive, indeed, but don't ask where or how. \nYou wouldn't understand a word, so I will begin by telling \nyou what happened on Sunday afternoon. \n\nAt three o'clock (Harry had just gone, but was coming \nback later) someone rang the front doorbell. I was lying lazily \nreading a book on the veranda in the sunshine, so I didn't \nhear it. A bit later, Margot appeared at the kitchen door look- \ning very excited. “The S.S. have sent a call-up notice for \nDaddy,” she whispered. “Mummy has gone to see Mr. Van \nDaan already.” (Van Daan is a friend who works with Daddy \nin the business.) It was a great shock to me, a call-up; every \none knows what that means. I picture concentration camps \nand lonely cells-should we allow him to be doomed to this? \n“Of course he won't go,” declared Margot, while we waited \ntogether. “Mummy has gone to the Van Daans to discuss \nwhether we should move into our hiding place tomorrow. \nThe Van Daans are going with us, so we shall be seven in all.” \nSilence. We couldn’t talk any more, thinking about Daddy, \nwho, little knowing what was going on, was visiting some old \npeople in the Joodse Invalide; waiting for Mummy, the heat \nand suspense, all made us very overawed and silent. \n\nSuddenly the bell rang again. “That is Harry,” I said. \n“Don't open the door.” Margot held me back, but it was not \nnecessary as we heard Mummy and Mr. Van Daan down- \nstairs, talking to Harry, then they came in and closed the door \nbehind them. Each time the bell went, Margot or I had to \ncreep softly down to see if it was Daddy, not opening the door \nto anyone else. \n\nMargot and I were sent out of the room. Van Daan wanted \nto talk to Mummy alone. When we were alone together in \nour bedroom, Margot told me that the call-up was not for \nDaddy, but for her. I was more frightened than ever and be- \ngan to cry. Margot is sixteen; would they really take girls of \nthat age away alone? But thank goodness she won't go, \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n13 \n\n\nMummy said so herself, that must be what Daddy meant \nwhen he talked about us going into hiding. \n\nInto hiding-where would we go, in a town or the country, \nin a house or a cottage, when, how, where . . .? \n\nThese were questions I was not allowed to ask, but I \ncouldn’t get them out of my mind. Margot and I began to \npack some of our most vital belongings into a school satchel. \nThe first thing I put in was this diary, then hair curlers, hand- \nkerchiefs, schoolbooks, a comb, old letters; I put in the \ncraziest things with the idea that we were going into hiding. \nBut I’m not sorry, memories mean more to me than dresses. \n\nAt five o’clock Daddy finally arrived, and we phoned Mr. \nKoophuis to ask if he could come around in the evening. Van \nDaan went and fetched Miep, Miep has been in the business \nwith Daddy since 1933 and has become a close fnend, like- \nwise her brand-new husband, Henk. Miep came and took \nsome shoes, dresses, coats, underwear, and stockings away in \nher bag, promising to return in the evening. Then silence fell \non the house; not one of us felt like eating anything, it was \nstill hot and everything was very strange. We let our large up- \nstairs room to a certain Mr. Goudsmit, a divorced man in his \nthirties, who appeared to have nothing to do -on this particu- \nlar evening; we simply could not get rid of him without being \nrude; he hung about until ten o’clock. At eleven o’clock Miep \nand Henk Van Santen arrived. Once again, shoes, stockings, \nbooks, and underclothes disappeared mto Miep’s bag and \nHenk’s deep pockets, and at eleven-thirty they too disap- \npeared. I was dog-tired and although I knew that it would he \nmy last night in my own bed, I fell asleep immediately and \ndidn’t wake up until Mummy called me at five-thirty the next \nmorning. Luckily it was not so hot as Sunday; warm ram fell \nsteadily all day. We put on heaps of clothes as if we were go- \ning to the North Pole, the sole reason being to take clothes \nwith us. No Jew in our situation would have dreamed of go- \ning out with a suitcase full of clothing. I had on two vests, \nthree pairs of pants, a dress, on top of that a skirt, jacket, \nsummer coat, two pairs of stockings, lace-up shoes, woolly \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK 14 \n\ncap, scarf, and still more; I was nearly stifled before we \nstarted, but no one inquired about that. \n\nMargot filled ber satchel with schoolbooks, fetched her \nbicycle, and rode off behind Miep into the unknown, as far \nas I was concerned. You see I still didn't know where our \nsecret hiding place was to be. At seven-thirty the door closed \nbehind us. Moortje, my little cat, was the only creature to \nwhom I said farewell. She would have a good home with the \nneighbors. This was all written in a letter addressed to Mr. \nGoudsmit. \n\nThere was one pound of meat in the kitchen for the cat, \nbreakfast things lying on the table, stripped beds, all giving \nthe impression that we had left helter-skelter. But we didn't \ncare about impressions, we only wanted to get away, only \nescape and arrive safely, nothing else. Continued tomorrow. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 9 July , 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nSo we walked in the pouring rain, Daddy, Mummy, and \nI, each with a school satchel and shopping bag filled to the \nbrim with all kinds of things thrown together anyhow. \n\nWe got sympathetic looks from people on their way to \nwork. You could see by their faces how sorry they were they \ncouldn’t offer us a lift; the gaudy yellow star spoke for itself. \n\nOnly when we were on the road did Mummy and Daddy \nbegin to tell me bits and pieces about the plan. For months \nas many of our goods and chattels and necessities of life as \npossible had been sent away and they were sufficiently ready \nfor us to have gone into hiding of our own accord on July 16. \nThe plan had had to be speeded up ten days because of the \ncall-up, so our quarters would not be so well organized, but \nwe had to make the best of it. The hiding place itself would \nbe in the building where Daddy has his office. It will be hard \nfor outsiders to understand, but I shall explain that later on. \nDaddy didn’t have many people working for him. Mr. Kraler, \n\n\n\n15 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nKoophuis, Miep, and E1H Vossen, a twenty-three-year-old \ntypist who all knew of our arrival. Mr. Vossen, Ellfs father, \nand two boys worked in the warehouse; they had not been \ntold. \n\n! I will describe the building: there is a large warehouse on \nthe ground floor which is used as a store. The front door to \nthe house is next to the warehouse door, and inside the front \ndoor is a second doorway which leads to a staircase (a). \nThere is another door at the top of the stairs, with a frosted \nglass window in it, which has “Office” written in black letters \nacross it. That is the large main office, very big, very light, and \nvery full. Elli, Miep, and Mr. Koophuis work there in the day- \ntime. A small dark room containing the safe, a wardrobe, and \na large cupboard leads to a small somewhat dark second office. \nMr. Kraler and Mr. Van Daan used to sit here, now it is only \nMr. Kraler. One can reach Kraler s office from the passage, \nbut only via a glass door which can be opened from the inside, \nbut not easily from the outside. \n\nFrom Kraler’s office a long passage goes past the coal store, \nup four steps and leads to the showroom of the whole build- \ning: the private office. Dark, dignified furniture, linoleum \nand carpets on the floor, radio, smart lamp, everything first- \nclass. Next door there is a roomy kitchen with a hot-water \nfaucet and a gas stove. Next door the W.C. That is the first \nfloor. \n\nA wooden staircase leads from the downstairs passage to \nthe next floor (b). There is a small landing at the top. There \nis a door at each end of the landing, the left one leading to a \nstoreroom at the front of the house and to the attics. One of \nthose really steep Dutch staircases runs from the side to the \nother door opening on to the street (c). \n\nThe right-hand door leads to our “Secret Annexe.” No one \nwould ever guess that there would be so many rooms hidden \nbehind that plain gray door. There s a little step in front of \nthe door and then you are inside. \n\nThere is a steep staircase immediately opposite the en- \ntrance (e). On the left a tiny passage brings you into a room \nwhich was to become the Frank family's bed-sitting-room, \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n16 \n\n\n\nnext door a smaller room, study and bedroom for the two \nyoung ladles of the f amil y. On the right a little room without \nwindows containing the washbasin and a small W.C. com- \npartment, with another door leading to Margot’s and my \nroom. If you go up the next flight of stairs and open the door, \nyou are simply amazed that there could be such a big light \nroom in such an old house by the canal. There is a gas stove \nin this room (thanks to the fact that it was used as a labora- \n\n\n\n17 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\ntory) and a sink. This is now the kitchen for the Van Daan \ncouple, besides being general living room, dining room, and \nscullery. \n\nA tiny little corridor room will become Peter Van Daan s \napartment. Then, just as on the lower landing, there is a \nlarge attic. So there you are, I’ve introduced you to the whole \nof our beautiful \"Secret Annexe.\" \n\nYours, Anne",

Rut still I think you should \nknow where we’ve landed. \n\nRut to continue my story— you see, I’ve not finished yet \n-when we arrived at the Prinsengracht, Miep took us quickly \nupstairs and into the \"Secret Annexe.” She closed the door \nbehind us and we were alone. Margot was already waiting \nfor us, having come much faster on her bicycle. Our living \nroom and all the other rooms were chock-full of rubbish, \nindescribably so. All the cardboard boxes which had been \nsent to the office in the previous months lay piled on the \nfloor and the beds. The little room was filled to the ceiling \nwith bedclothes. We had to start clearing up immediately, \nif we wished to sleep in decent beds that night. Mummy \nand Margot were not in a fit state to take part; they were \ntired and lay down on their beds, they were miserable, and \nlots more besides. Rut the two “clearers-up” of the family— \nDaddy and myself— wanted to start at once. \n\nThe whole day long we unpacked boxes, filled cupboards, \nhammered and tidied, until we were dead beat. We sank into \nclean beds that night. We hadn’t had a bit of anything warm \nthe whole day, but we didn’t care; Mummy and Margot were \ntoo tired and keyed up to eat, and Daddy and I were too \nbusy. \n\nOn Tuesday morning we went on where we left off the \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n18 \n\n\nday before. Elli and Miep collected our rations for ns, Daddy \nimproved the poor blackout, we scrubbed the kitchen floor, \nand were on the go the whole day long again. I hardly had \ntime to think about the great change in my life until Wed- \nnesday. Then I had a chance, for the first time since our \narrival, to tell you all about it, and at the same time to realize \nmyself what had actually happened to me and what was still \ngoing to happen. \n\nYours, Anne",

I can. I loved it from the start, and \nespecially in the night it's like a faithful friend. I expect \nyou will be interested to hear what it feels like to ‘‘disappear”; \nwell, all I can say is that I don’t know myself yet. I don’t \nthink I shall ever feel really at home in this house, but \nthat does not mean that I loathe it here, it is more like \nbeing on vacation in a very peculiar boardinghouse. Rather \na mad idea, perhaps, but that is how it strikes me. The \n“Secret Annexe” is an ideal hiding place. Although it leans \nto one side and is damp, you’d never find such a comfortable \nhiding place anywhere in Amsterdam, no, perhaps not even \nin the whole of Holland. Our little room looked very bare \nat first with nothing on the walls; but thanks to Daddy \nwho had brought my film-star collection and picture post- \ncards on beforehand, and with the aid of paste pot and \nbrush, I have transformed the walls into one gigantic pic- \nture. This makes it look much more cheerful, and, when \nthe Van Daans come, we’ll get some wood from the attic, \nand make a few little cupboards for the walls and other odds \nand ends to make it look more lively. \n\nMargot and Mummy are a little bit better now. Mummy \nfelt well enough to cook some soup for the first time yester- \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n19 \n\n\nday, but then forgot all about it, while she was downstairs \ntalking, so the peas were burned to a cinder and utterly \nrefused to leave the pan. Mr. Koophuis has brought me a \nbook called Young People’s Annual. The four of us went \nto the private office yesterday evening and turned on the \nradio. I was so terribly frightened that someone might hear \nit that I simply begged Daddy to come upstairs with me. \nMummy understood how I felt and came too. We are very \nnervous in other ways, too, that the neighbors might hear \nus or see something going on. We made curtains straight \naway on the first day. Really one can hardly call them cur- \ntains, they are just light, loose strips of material, all different \nshapes, quality, and pattern, which Daddy and I sewed to- \ngether in a most unprofessional way. These works of art \nare fixed in position with drawing pins, not to come down \nuntil we emerge from here. \n\nThere are some large business premises on the right of \nus, and on the left a furniture workshop; there is no one \nthere after working hours but even so, sounds could travel \nthrough the walls. We have forbidden Margot to cough at \nnight, although she has a bad cold, and make her swallow \nlarge doses of codeine. I am looking for Tuesday when the \nVan Daans arrive; it will be much more fun and not so quiet. \nIt is the silence that frightens me so in the evenings and at \nnight. I wish like anything that one of our protectors could \nsleep here at night. I can't tell you how oppressive it is \nnever to be able to go outdoors, also Im very afraid that we \nshall be discovered and be shot. That is not exactly a pleasant \nprospect. We have to whisper and tread lightly during the \nday, otherwise the people in the warehouse might hear us. \n\nSomeone is calling me. \n\n' Yours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Friday , 14 August , 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI have deserted you for a whole month, but honestly, \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n20 \n\n\nthere is so little news here that I can’t find amusing things \nto tell you every day. The Van Daans arrived on July 13. We \nthought they were coming on the fourteenth, but between \nthe thirteenth and sixteenth of July the Germans called up \npeople right and left which created more and more unrest, \nso they played for safety, better a day too early than a day \ntoo late. At nine-thirty in the morning (we were still having \nbreakfast) Peter arrived, the Van Daans’ son, not sixteen \nyet, a rather soft, shy, gawky youth; can’t expect much from \nhis company. He brought his cat (Mouschi) with him. Mr. \nand Mrs. Van Daan arrived half an hour later, and to our \ngreat amusement she had a large pottie in her hat box. “I \ndon’t feel at home anywhere without my chamber,” she \ndeclared, so it was the first thing to find its permanent rest- \ning place under her divan. Mr. Van Daan did not bring his, \nbut carried a folding tea table under his arm. \n\nFrom the day they arrived we all had meals cozily together \nand after three days it was just as if we were one large \nfamily. Naturally the Van Daans were able to tell us a lot \nabout the extra week they had spent in the inhabited world. \nAmong other things we were very interested to hear what \nhad happened to our house and to Mr. Goudsmit. Mr. Van \nDaan told us: \n\n“Mr. Goudsmit phoned at nine o’clock on Monday morn- \ning and asked if I could come around. I went immediately \nand found G. in a state of great agitation. He let me read a \nletter that the Franks had left behind and wanted to take \nthe cat to the neighbors as indicated in the letter, which \npleased me. Mr. G. was afraid that the house would be \nsearched so we went through all the rooms, tidied up a bit, \nand cleared away the breakfast things. Suddenly I discovered \na writing pad on Mrs. Frank’s desk with an address in \nMaastricht written on it. Although I knew that this was \ndone on purpose, I pretended to be very surprised and \nshocked and urged Mr. G. to tear up this unfortunate little \npiece of paper without delay. \n\n“I went on pretending that I knew nothing of your dis- \nappearance all the time, but after seeing the paper, I got a \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n21 \n\n\nbrain wave. ‘Mr. Goudsmit’—I said — it suddenly dawns on \nme what this address may refer to. Now it all comes back \nto me, a high-ranking officer was in the office about six \nmonths ago, he appeared to be very friendly with Mr. Frank \nand offered to help him, should the need arise. He was sta- \ntioned in Maastricht. I think he must have kept his word \nand somehow or other managed to get them into Belgium \nand then on to Switzerland. I should tell this to any friends \nwho may inquire. Don’t, of course, mention Maastricht/ \n\n“With these words I left the house. Most of your friends \nknow already, because I’ve been told myself several times \nby different people.” \n\nWe were highly amused at the story and, when Mr. Van \nDaan gave us further details, laughed still more at the way \npeople can let their imagination run away with them. One \nfamily had seen the pair of us pass on bicycles very early \nin the morning and another lady knew quite definitely that \nwe were fetched by a military car in the middle of the night \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Wednesday , 2 September , 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMr. and Mrs. Van Daan have had a terrific quarrel, I’ve \nnever seen anything quite like it before. Mummy and Daddy \nwould never dream of shouting at each other. The cause \nwas so trivial that the whole thing was a pure waste of breath. \nBut, still, everyone to his own liking. \n\nNaturally it is very unpleasant for Peter, who has to stand \nby. No one takes him seriously, he is so frightfully touchy \nand lazy. Yesterday he was badly upset because he found \nthat his tongue was blue instead of red; this unusual phe- \nnomenon of nature disappeared just as quickly as it had come. \nToday he is going about with a scarf on, as he has a stiff \nneck; in addition “M’lord” complains of lumbago. Pains \naround the heart, kidneys, and lungs are not unusual either, \nhe is a real hypochondria (that’s the word for such people, \nisn’t it?)! It is not all honey between Mummy and Mrs. \nVan Daan; there is plenty of cause for unpleasantness. To \ngive a small example, I will tell you that Mrs. Van Daan has \ntaken all three of her sheets out of the common linen cup- \nboard. She takes it for granted that Mummy’s sheets will do \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n23 \n\n\nfor all of us. It will be a nasty surprise for her when she finds \nthat Mummy has followed her good example. \n\nAlso, she is thoroughly piqued that her dinner service \nand not ours is in use. She is always trying to find out where \nwe have actually put our plates; they are closer than she \nthinks, they are in a cardboard box behind a lot of junk in \nthe attic. Our plates are unget-at-able as long as we are \nhere, and a good thing too. I always have bad luck; I smashed \none of Mrs. Van Daan’s soup plates into a thousand pieces \nyesterday. “Oh!” she cried angrily. “Couldn't you be care- \nful for once— that's the last one I've got.” Mr. Van Daan \nis all sugar to me nowadays. Long may it last. Mummy gave \nme another frightful sermon this morning; I can't bear them. \nOur ideas are completely opposite. Daddy is a darling, al- \nthough he can sometimes be angry with me for five minutes \non end. Last week we had a httle interruption in our monoto- \nnous life; it was over a book about women-and Peter. \nFirst I must tell you that Margot and Peter are allowed to \nread nearly all the books that Mr. Koophuis lends us, but \nthe grownups held back this particular book on the subject \nof women. Peter s curiosity was aroused at once. What was \nit the two of them were not allowed to read in this book? \nHe got hold of the book on the sly, while his mother was \ndownstairs talking, and disappeared with his booty to the \nattic. All went well for a few days. His mother knew what \nhe was doing, but didn't tell tales, until Father found out. \nHe was very angry, took the book away, and thought that \nthat would finish the whole business. However, he had not \nallowed for his sons curiosity, which waxed rather than \nwaned because of his father's attitude. Peter, determined to \nfinish it, thought of a way to get hold of this enthralling \nbook. In the meantime, Mrs. Van Daan had asked Mummy \nwhat she thought about it all. Mummy thought this par- \nticular book was not suitable for Margot, but she saw no \nharm in letting her read most books. \n\n“There is a great difference, Mrs. Van Daan,” said \nMummy, “between Margot and Peter. In the first place, \nMargot is a girl and girls are always more grownup than \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n24 \n\n\nboys, secondly, Margot has read quite a lot of serious books, \nand does not go in search of things that are forbidden her, \nand thirdly, Margot is far more developed and intelligent, \nshown by the fact of her being in the fourth form at school.” \nMrs, Van Daan agreed, but still thought it was wrong in \nprinciple to let children read books which were written for \ngrownups. \n\nIn the meantime Peter had found a time of the day when \nno one bothered about him or the book: seven-thirty in the \nevening— then everyone was in the private office listening \nto the radio. That was when he took his treasure to the \nattic, again. He should have been downstairs again by eight- \nthirty, but because the book was so thrilling he forgot the \ntime and was just coming downstairs as his father came into \nthe room. You can imagine the consequences! With a slap \nand a snatch, the book lay on the table and Peter was in the \nattic. That’s how matters stood as we sat down to table. \nPeter stayed upstairs~no one bothered about him, and he \nhad to go to bed without any supper. We went on with the \nmeal, chattering gaily, when suddenly we heard a piercing \nwhistle; we all stopped eating and looked with pale changed \nfaces from one to another. Then we heard Peter’s voice, call- \ning down the chimney, “I say, I’m not coming down anyway.” \nMr. Van Daan sprang to his feet, his napkin fell to the floor, \nand scarlet in the face he shouted, Tve had enough of \nthis.” Daddy took his arm, afraid of what might happen, and \nthe two men went together to the attic. After a good deal of \nresistance and stamping, Peter landed up in his room with \nthe door closed and we went on eating. Mrs. Van Daan \nwanted to save one slice of bread for the dear boy, but his \nfather stood firm. “If he doesn’t apologize soon, he will have \nto sleep in the attic.” Loud protests from the rest of us, as \nwe thought missing supper was quite enough punishment. \nBesides, Peter might catch cold and we couldn’t call a doctor. \n\nPeter did not apologize; he was already in the attic. Mr. \nVan Daan did nothing more about it, but I noticed the next \nmorning that Peter s bed had been slept in. Peter was back \nin the attic at seven o’clock, but Daddy managed with a \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n25 \n\n\nfew friendly words to persuade him to come down again. \nSour faces and obstinate silences for three days and then \neverything went smoothly once more. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Monday , 21 September , 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nToday fm going to tell you our general news. \n\nMrs. Van Daan is unbearable. I get nothing but \"blow- \nups” from her for my continuous chatter. She is always pester- \ning us in some way or other. This is the latest, she doesn't \nwant to wash up the pans if there is a fragment left; instead \nof putting it into a glass dish, as we’ve always done until \nnow, she leaves it in the pan to go bad. \n\nAfter the next meal Margot sometimes has about seven \npans to wash up and then Madame says: \"Well, well, Mar- \ngot, you have got a lot to do!” \n\nI’m busy with Daddy working out his family tree: as we \ngo along he tells me little bits about everyone— it’s terribly \ninteresting. Mr. Koophuis brings a few special books for me \nevery other week. I’m thrilled with the Joop ter Heul series. \nI’ve enjoyed the whole of Cissy van Marxveldt very much. \nAnd I’ve read Een Zomerzotheid four times and I still laugh \nabout some of the ludicrous situations that arise. \n\nTerm time has begun again, I’m working hard at my \nFrench and manage to pump in five irregular verbs per day. \nPeter sighs and groans over his English. A few schoolbooks \nhave just arrived; we have a good stock of exercise books, \npencils, rubbers, and labels, as I brought these with me. I \nsometimes listen to the Dutch news from London, heard \nPrince Bernhard recently. He said that Princess Juliana is \nexpecting a baby about next January. I think it is lovely; it \nsurprises the others that I should be so keen on the Royal \nFamily. \n\nI was being discussed and they decided that I’m not com- \npletely stupid after all, which had the effect of making me \n\n\n\nANNE FRAEUS 26 \n\nwork extra hard the next day. I certainly don’t want to \nstill be in the first form when Im fourteen or fifteen. \n\nAlso the fact that Im hardly allowed to read any decent \nbooks was mentioned. Mummy is reading Heeren, Vromoen \nen Knechten now, which Im not allowed (Margot is). First \nI must be more developed, like my talented sister. Then we \ntalk about my ignorance of philosophy and psychology, about \nwhich I know nothing. Perhaps by next year I shall be \nwiser! (I looked up these difficult words quickly in Koenen.) \n\nI have just woken up to the disturbing fact that I have \none long-sleeved dress and three cardigans for the winter. \nI’ve received permission from Daddy to knit a jumper of \nwhite sheep’s wool; it’s not very nice wool, but as long as it’s \nwarm that’s all that matters. We have some clothes de- \nposited with friends, but unfortunately we shall not see them \nuntil after the war, that is if they are still there then. I had \njust written something about Mrs. Van Daan when in she \ncame. Slap! I closed the book. “Hey, Anne, can’t I just have \na look?” \n\n“I’m afraid not.” \n\n“Just the last page then?” \n\n“No, I’m sorry.” \n\nNaturally it gave me a frightful shock, because there was \nan unflattering description of her on this particular page. \n\nYours, Anne",

Sometimes it \ncan be quite fun. Then we have some moth biscuits (the \nbiscuit tin is kept in the wardrobe which is full of moth \nballs) and drink lemonade. We talked about Peter.

I \nthought “Oh dear!” and said: “Oh, no!” Imagine it! \n\nI did say that I thought Peter rather awkward, but that it \nwas probably shyness, as many boys who haven't had much \nto do with girls are like that. \n\nI must say that the Refuge Committee of the “Secret \nAnnexe” (male section) is very ingenious. Ill tell you what \nthey've done now to get news of us through to Mr. Van \nDijk, Travies’ chief representative and a friend who has sur- \nreptitiously hidden some of our things for us! They typed \na letter to a chemist in South Zeeland, who does business \nwith our firm, in such a way that he has to send the enclosed \nreply back in an addressed envelope. Daddy addressed the \nenvelope to the office. When this envelope arrives from \nZeeland, the enclosed letter is taken out, and is replaced by \na message in Daddy's handwriting as a sign of life. Like \nthis, Van Dijk won't become suspicious when he reads the \nnote. They specially chose Zeeland because it is so close to \nBelgium and the letter could have easily been smuggled over \nthe border, in addition no one is allowed into Zeeland with- \nout a special permit; so if they thought we were there, he \ncouldn't try and look us up. \n\nYours, Anne",

As a rule we don’t go \nin for such outbursts as this in our family. Still, it's by no \nmeans always pleasant for me. Margot's and Mummy’s natures \nare completely strange to me. I can understand my friends \nbetter than my own mother-too bad! \n\nWe often discuss postwar problems, for example, how one \nought to address servants. \n\nMrs. Van Daan had another tantrum. She is terribly moody. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n28 \n\n\nShe keeps hiding more of her private belongings. Mummy \nought to answer each Van Daan “disappearance” with a Frank \n“disappearance.” How some people do adore bringing up \nother people's children in addition to their own. The Van \nDaans are that kind. Margot doesn’t need it, she is such a \ngoody-goody, perfection itself, but I seem to have enough mis- \nchief in me for the two of us put together. You should hear us \nat mealtimes, with reprimands and cheeky answers flying to \nand fro. Mummy and Daddy always defend me stoutly. I’d \nhave to give up if it weren't for them. Although they do tell \nme that I mustn't talk so much, that I must be more retiring \nand not poke my nose into everything, still I seem doomed to \nfailure. If Daddy wasn't so patient, I’d be afraid I was going \nto turn out to be a terrific disappointment to my parents and \nthey are pretty lenient with me. \n\nIf I take a small helping of some vegetable I detest and \nmake up with potatoes, the Van Daans, and Mevrouw in par- \nticular, can’t get over it, that any child should be so spoiled. \n\n“Come along, Anne, have a few more vegetables,” she says \nstraight away. \n\n“No, thank you, Mrs. Van Daan,” I answer, “I have plenty \nof potatoes.” \n\n“Vegetables are good for you, your mother says so too. Have \na few more,” she says, pressing them on me until Daddy comes \nto my rescue. \n\nThen we have from Mrs. Van Daan-“You ought to have \nbeen in our home, we were properly brought up. It’s absurd \nthat Anne's so frightfully spoiled. I wouldn’t put up with it if \nAnne were my daughter.” \n\nThese are always her first and last words “if Anne were my \ndaughter.” Thank heavens I’m not! \n\nBut to come back to this “upbringing” business. There was \na deadly silence after Mrs. Van Daan had finished speaking \nyesterday. Then Daddy said, “I think Anne is extremely well \nbrought up; she has learned one thing anyway, and that is to \nmake no reply to your long sermons. As to the vegetables, \nlook at your own plate.” Mrs. Van Daan was beaten, well and \ntruly beaten. She had taken a minute helping of vegetables \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n29 \n\n\nherself. But she is not spoiled! Oh, no, too many vegetables in \nthe evening make her constipated. Why on earth doesn’t she \nkeep her mouth shut about me, then she wouldn’t need to \nmake such feeble excuses. It’s gorgeous the way Mrs. Van \nDaan blushes. I don’t and that is just what she hates. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Monday , 28 September, 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI had to stop yesterday, long before I’d finished. I just must \ntell you about another quarrel, but before I start on that, \nsomething else. \n\nWhy do grownups quarrel so easily, so much, and over the \nmost idiotic things? Up till now I thought that only children \nsquabbled and that that wore off as you grew up. Of course, \nthere is sometimes a real reason for a quarrel, but this is just \nplain bickering. I suppose I should get used to it. But I can’t \nnor do I think I shall, as long as I am the subject of nearly \nevery discussion (they use the word “discussion” instead of \nquarrel). Nothing, I repeat, nothing about me is right; my \ngeneral appearance, my character, my manners are discussed \nfrom A to Z. I’m expected (by order) to simply swallow all \nthe harsh words and shouts in silence and I am not used to \nthis. In fact, I can t! I’m not going to take all these insults ly- \ning down, I’ll show them that Anne Frank wasn’t born yester- \nday. Then they’ll be surprised and perhaps they’ll keep their \nmouths shut when I let them see that I am going to start edu- \ncating them. Shall I take up that attitude? Plain barbarism! I’m \nsimply amazed again and again over their awful manners and \nespecially . . . stupidity (Mrs. Van Daan’s), but as soon as I \nget used to this-and it won’t be long-then I’ll give them some \nof their own back, and no half measures. Then they’ll change \ntheir tune! \n\nAm I really so bad-mannered, conceited, headstrong, push- \ning, stupid, lazy, etc., etc., as they all say? Oh, of course not. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n30 \n\n\nI have my faults, just like everyone else, I know that, but they \nthoroughly exaggerate everything. \n\nKitty, if only you knew how I sometimes boil under so many \ngibes and jeers. And I don't know how long I shall be able to \nstifle my rage. I shall just blow up one day. \n\nStill, no more of this, I’ve bored you long enough with all \nthese quarrels. But I simply must tell you of one highly inter- \nesting discussion at table. Somehow or other, we got on to the \nsubject of Pirn’s (Daddy’s nickname) extreme modesty. Even \nthe most stupid people have to admit this about Daddy. Sud- \ndenly Mrs. Van Daan says, “I too, have an unassuming nature, \nmore so than my husband.” \n\nDid you ever! This sentence in itself shows quite clearly \nhow thoroughly forward and pushing she is! Mr. Van Daan \nthought he ought to give an explanation regarding the refer- \nence to himself. “I don't wish to be modest— in my experience \nit does not pay.” Then to me: “Take my advice, Anne, don’t \nbe too unassuming, it doesn’t get you anywhere.” \n\nMummy agreed with this too. But Mrs. Van Daan had to \nadd, as always, her ideas on the subject. Her next remark was \naddressed to Mummy and Daddy. “You have a strange out- \nlook on life. Fancy saying such a thing to Anne; it was very \ndifferent when I was young. And I feel sure that it still is, ex- \ncept in your modem home.” This was a direct hit at the way \nMummy brings up her daughters. \n\nMrs. Van Daan was scarlet by this time. Mummy calm and \ncool as a cucumber. People who blush get so hot and excited, \nit is quite a handicap in such a situation. Mummy, still entirely \nunruffled, but anxious to close the conversation as soon as pos- \nsible, thought for a second and then said: “I find, too, Mrs. \nVan Daan, that one gets on better in life if one is not over- \nmodest. My husband, now, and Margot, and Peter are excep- \ntionally modest, whereas your husband, Anne, you, and I, \nthough not exactly the opposite, don’t allow ourselves to be \ncompletely pushed to one side.” Mrs. Van Daan: “But, Mrs. \nFrank, I don’t understand you; I’m so very modest and retiring, \nhow can you think of calling me anything else?” Mummy: “I \ndid not say you were exactly forward, but no one could say \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n31 \n\n\nyon had a retiring disposition.” Mrs. Van Daan: “Let us get this \nmatter cleared up, once and for all. I’d like to know in what \nway I am pushing? I know one thing, if I didn’t look after my- \nself, I’d soon be starving.” \n\nThis absurd remark in self-defense just made Mummy rock \nwith laughter. That irritated Mrs. Van Daan, who added a \nstring of German-Dutch, Dutch-German expressions, until she \nbecame completely tongue-tied; then she rose from her chair \nand was about to leave the room. \n\nSuddenly her eye fell on me. You should have seen her. Un- \nfortunately, at the very moment that she turned round, I was \nshaking my head sorrowfully-not on purpose, but quite in- \nvoluntarily, for I had been following the whole conversation \nso closely. \n\nMrs. Van Daan turned round and began to reel off a lot of \nharsh German, common, and ill-mannered, just like a coarse, \nred-faced fishwife— it was a marvelous sight. If I could draw, \nI’d have liked to catch her like this; it was a scream, such a \nstupid, foolish little person! \n\nAnyhow, I’ve learned one thing now. You only really get to \nknow people when you’ve had a jolly good row with them. \nThen and then only can you judge their true characters! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Tuesday, 29 September , 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nExtraordinary things can happen to people who go into hid- \ning. Just imagine, as there is no bath, we use a washtub and \nbecause there is hot water m the office (by which I always \nmean the whole of the lower floor) all seven of us take it in \nturns to make use of this great luxury. \n\nBut because we are all so different and some are more mod- \nest than others, each member of the family has found his own \nplace for carrying out the performance. Peter uses the kitchen \nin spite of its glass door When he is going to have a bath, he \ngoes to each one of us in turn and tells us that we must not \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n82 \n\n\nwalk past the kitchen for half an hour. He seems to think this \nis sufficient. Mr. Van Daan goes right upstairs; to him it is \nworth the bother of carrying hot water all that way, so as to \nhave the seclusion of his own room. Mrs. Van Daan simply \ndoesn't bathe at all at present; she is waiting to see which is \nthe best place. Daddy has his bath in the private office, Mum- \nmy behind a fire guard in the kitchen; Margot and I have \nchosen the front office for our scrub. The curtains there are \ndrawn on Saturday afternoons, so we wash ourselves in semi- \ndarkness. \n\nHowever, I don't like this place any longer, and since last \nweek I've been on the lookout for more comfortable quarters. \nPeter gave me an idea and that was to try the large office \nW.C. There I can sit down, have the light on, lock the door, \npour my own bath water away, and I'm safe from prying eyes. \n\nI tried my beautiful bathroom on Sunday for the first time \nand although it sounds mad, I think it is the best place of all. \nLast week the plumber was at work downstairs to move the \ndrains and water pipes from the office W.C. to the passage. \nThis change is a precaution against frozen pipes, in case we \nshould have a cold winter. The plumber's visit was far from \npleasant for us. Not only were we unable to draw water the \nwhole day, but we could not go to the W.C. either. Now it is \nrather indecent to tell you what we did to overcome this diffi- \nculty, however, I'm not such a prude that I can't talk about \nthese things. \n\nThe day we arrived here, Daddy and I improvised a pottie \nfor ourselves; not having a better receptacle, we sacrificed a \nglass preserving jar for this purpose. During the plumbers \nvisit, nature's offerings were deposited in these jars in the sit- \nting room during the day. I don’t think this was nearly as bad \nas having to sit still and not talk the whole day. You can’t im- \nagine what a trial that was for “Miss Quack-Quack.” I have to \nwhisper on ordinary days; but not being able to speak or move \nwas ten times worse. After being flattened by three days of \ncontinuous sitting, my bottom was very stiff and painful. Some \nexercises at bedtime helped. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n33",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 1 October > 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI got a terrible shock yesterday. Suddenly at eight o clock \nthe bell rang loudly. Of course, I thought that someone had \ncome: you 11 guess who I mean. But I calmed down a bit when \neveryone said it must be some urchins or perhaps the postman. \n\nThe days are becoming very quiet here. Lewin, a small \nJewish chemist and dispenser, works for Mr. Kraler in the \nkitchen. He knows the whole building well and therefore we \nare always afraid that he'll take it into his head to have a peep \nin the old laboratory. We are as quiet as mice. Who, three \nmonths ago, would ever have guessed that quicksilver Anne \nwould have to sit still for hours-and, what's more, could? \n\nThe twenty-ninth was Mrs. Van Daan's birthday. Although \nit could not be celebrated in a big way, we managed a little \nparty in her honor, with a specially nice meal, and she re- \nceived some small presents and flowers. Red carnations from \nher husband; that seems to be a family tradition. To pause for \na moment on the subject of Mrs. Van Daan, I must tell you \nthat her attempts to flirt with Daddy are a source of continual \nirritation for me. She strokes his face and hair, pulls her skirt \nright up, and makes so-called witty remarks, trying in this way \nto attract Pirn's attention. Pirn, thank goodness, doesn’t find \nher either attractive or funny, so he doesn't play ball. Mummy \ndoesn’t behave like that with Mr. Van Daan, I’ve said that to \nMrs. Van Daan’s face. \n\nNow and then Peter comes out of his shell and can be quite \nfunny. We have one thing in common, from which everyone \nusually gets a lot of amusement: we both love dressing up. He \nappeared in one of Mrs. Van Daan’s very narrow dresses and I \nput on his suit. He wore a hat and I a cap. The grownups were \ndoubled up with laughter and we enjoyed ourselves as much \nas they did. Elli has bought new skirts for Margot and me at \nBijenkorf's. The material is rotten, just like sacking, and they \ncost 24.00 florins and 7,50 florins respectively. What a differ- \nence compared with before the war! \n\nAnother nice thing I've been keeping up my sleeve. Elli has \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n34 \n\n\nwritten to some secretarial school or other and ordered a cor- \nrespondence course in shorthand for Margot, Peter, and me. \nYou wait and see what perfect experts we shall be by next \nyear. In any case its extremely important to be able to write \nin a code. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Friday , 9 October , 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI’ve only got dismal and depressing news for you today. \nOur many Jewish friends are being taken away by the dozen. \nThese people are treated by the Gestapo without a shred \nof decency, being loaded into cattle trucks and sent to \nWesterbork, the big Jewish camp in Drente. Westerbork \nsounds terrible: only one washing cubicle for a hundred \npeople and not nearly enough lavatories There is no separate \naccommodation. Men, women, and children all sleep to- \ngether. One hears of frightful immorality because of this; \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 35 \n\nand a lot of the women, and even girls, who stay there any \nlength of time are expecting babies. \n\nIt is impossible to escape; most of the people in the camp \nare branded as inmates by their shaven heads and many also \nby their Jewish appearance. \n\nIf it is as bad as this in Holland whatever will it be like \nin the distant and barbarous regions they are sent to? We \nassume that most of them are murdered. The English radio \nspeaks of their being gassed. \n\nPerhaps that is the quickest way to die. I feel terribly \nupset. I couldn't tear myself away while Miep told these \ndreadful stories; and she herself was equally wound up for \nthat matter. Just recently for instance, a poor old crippled \nJewess was sitting on her doorstep; she had been told to wait \nthere by the Gestapo, who had gone to fetch a car to take \nher away. The poor old thing was terrified by the guns that \nwere shooting at English planes overhead, and by the glaring \nbeams of the searchlights. But Miep did not dare take her \nin; no one would undergo such a risk. The Germans strike \nwithout the slightest mercy. Elli too is very quiet: her boy \nfriend has got to go to Germany. She is afraid that the air- \nmen who fly over our homes will drop their bombs, often \nweighing a million kilos, on Dirk's head. Jokes such as “he's \nnot likely to get a million\" and “it only takes one bomb\" are \nin rather bad taste. Dirk is certainly not the only one who \nhas to go: trainloads of boys leave daily. If they stop at a \nsmall station en route, sometimes some of them manage to \nget out unnoticed and escape; perhaps a few manage it. This, \nhowever, is not the end of my bad news. Have you ever heard \nof hostages? That's the latest thing in penalties for sabotage. \nCan you imagine anything so dreadful? \n\nProminent citizens— innocent people— are thrown into \nprison to await their fate. If the saboteur can't be traced, the \nGestapo simply put about five hostages against the wall. \nAnnouncements of their deaths appear in the papers fre- \nquently. These outrages are described as “fatal accidents.\" \nNice people, the Germans! To think that I was once one \nof them too! No, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n36 \n\n\nIn fact, Germans and Jews are the greatest enemies in the \nworld. \n\nYours, Anne",

Then a per- \nfectly foul math problem and three pages of French grammar. \nI flatly refuse to do these math problems every day. Daddy \nagrees that they’re vile. I’m almost better at them than he is, \nthough neither of us are much good and we often have to \nfetch Margot. I’m the furthest on of the three of us in \nshorthand. \n\nYesterday I finished The Assault. It’s quite amusing, but \ndoesn’t touch Joop ter Heul. As a matter of fact, I think \nCissy van Marxveldt is a first-rate writer. I shall definitely let \nmy children read her books. Mummy, Margot, and I are as \nthick as thieves again. It’s really much better. Margot and I \ngot in the same bed together last evening; it was a frightful \nsquash, but that was just the fun of it. She asked if she could \nread my diary. I said “Yes-at least, bits of it”; and then I \nasked if I could read hers and she said “Yes.” Then we got on \nto the subject of the future. I asked her what she wanted to \nbe. But she wouldn’t say and made a great secret of it. I \ngathered something about teaching; I’m not sure if I’m right, \nbut I think so. Really, I shouldn’t be so curious! \n\nThis morning I was lying on Peter’s bed, having chased \nhim off at first. He was furious with me, not that I cared \nvery much. He might be a bit more friendly with me for \nonce; after all I did give him an apple yesterday. \n\nI asked Margot if she thought I was very ugly. She said \nthat I was quite attractive and that I had nice eyes. Rather \nvague, don’t you think? \n\nTill next time, \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\n37 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL",

I should explain that there are five fire ex- \ntinguishers in the house. We knew that someone was coming \nto fill them, but no one had warned us when the carpenter, \nor whatever you call him, was coming. \n\nThe result was that we weren’t making any attempt to \nkeep quiet, until I heard hammering outside on the landing \nopposite our cupboard door. I thought of the carpenter at \nonce and warned Elli, who was having a meal with us, that \nshe shouldn’t go downstairs. Daddy and I posted ourselves \nat the door so as to hear when the man left. After he d been \nworking for a quarter of an hour, he laid his hammer and \ntools down on top of our cupboard (as we thought) and \nknocked at our door. We turned absolutely white. Perhaps \n' he had heard some thin g after all and wanted to investigate \nour secret den. It seemed like it. The knocking, pulling, push- \ning, and wrenching went on. I nearly fainted at the thought \nthat this utter stranger might discover our beautiful secret \nhiding place. And just as I thought my last hour was at hand, \nI heard Mr. Koophuis say, \"Open the door, its only me. \nWe opened it immediately. The hook that holds the cup- \nboard, which can be undone by people who know the secret, \nhad got jammed. That was why no one had been able to \nwarn us about the carpenter. The man had now gone^ down- \nstairs and Koophuis wanted to fetch Elli, but eouldnt open \nthe cupboard again. It was a great relief to me, I can tell you. \nIn my imagination the man who I thought was trying to get \nm had been growing and growing in size until in the end he \nappeared to be a giant and the greatest fascist that ever walked \nthe earth. \n\nWeill Weill Luckily everything was okay this time. Mean- \nwhile we had great fun on Monday. Miep and Henk spent \nthe night here. Margot and I went in Mummy and Daddy s \nroom for the night, so that the Van Santens could have our \nroom. The meal tasted divine. There was one small inter- \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n38 \n\n\nruption. Daddy's lamp blew a fuse, and all of a sudden we \nwere sitting in darkness. What was to be done? There was \nsome fuse wire in the house, but the fuse box is right at the \nvery back of the dark storeroom-not such a nice job after \ndark. Still the men ventured forth and after ten minutes we \nwere able to put the candles away again. \n\nI got up early this morning. Henk had to leave at half past \neight. After a cozy breakfast Miep went downstairs. It was \npouring and she was glad not to have to cycle to the office. \nNext week Elli is coming to stay for a night. \n\nYours, Anne",

Think of it, \nwe can't even call a doctor! Mummy is letting him have \na good sweat. Perhaps that will send his temperature down. \n\nThis morning Miep told us that all the furniture has \nbeen removed from the Van Daans’ home. We haven’t told \nMrs. Van Daan yet. She’s such a bundle of nerves already, \nand we don’t feel like listening to another moan over all the \nlovely china and beautiful chairs that she left at home. We \nhad to leave almost all our nice things behind; so what’s the \ngood of grumbling about it now? \n\nI’m allowed to read more grown-up books lately. I’m \nnow reading Em’s Youth by Nico van Suchtelen. I can’t \nsee much difference between this and the schoolgirl love \nstories. It is true there are bits about women selling them- \nselves to unknown men in back streets. They ask a packet of \nmoney for it. I’d die of shame if anything like that happened \nto me. Also it says that Eva has a monthly period. Oh, I’m \nso longing to have it too; it seems so important. \n\nDaddy has brought the plays of Goethe and Schiller from \nthe big cupboard. He is going to read to me every evening. \nWe’ve started with Don Carlos. \n\nFollowing Daddy’s good example, Mummy has pressed \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n39 \n\n\nher prayer book into my hand. For decency's sake I read \nsome of the prayers in German; they are certainly beautiful \nbut they don’t convey much to me. Why does she force me \nto be pious, just to oblige her? \n\nTomorrow we are going to light the fire for the first time. \nI expect we shall be suffocated with smoke. The chimney \nhasn’t been swept for ages, let’s hope the thing draws. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Saturday , 7 November , 1942 \n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMummy is frightfully irritable and that always seems to \nherald unpleasantness for me. Is it just a chance that Daddy \nand Mummy never rebuke Margot and that they always \ndrop on me for everything? Yesterday evening, for instance: \nMargot was reading a book with lovely drawings in it; she \ngot up and went upstairs, put the book down ready to go \non with it later. I wasn’t doing anything, so picked up the \nbook and started looking at the pictures. Margot came back, \nsaw “her” book in my hands, wrinkled her forehead and \nasked for the book back. Just because I wanted to look a \nlittle further on, Margot got more and more angry. Then \nMummy joined in: “Give the book to Margot; she was \nreading it,” she said. Daddy came into the room. He didn’t \neven know what it was all about, but saw the injured look \non Margot’s face and promptly dropped on me: “I’d like to \nsee what you’d say if Margot ever started looking at one of \nyour books!” I gave way at once, laid the book down, and \nleft the room-offended, as they thought. It so happened I \nwas neither offended nor cross, just miserable. It wasn’t right \nof Daddy to judge without knowing what the squabble was \nabout. I would have given Margot the book myself, and \nmuch more quickly, if Mummy and Daddy hadn’t interfered. \nThey took Margot’s part at once, as though she were the \nvictim of some great injustice. \n\nIt’s obvious that Mummy would stick up for Margot; she \nand Margot always do back each other up. I’m so used to \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n40 \n\n\nthat that Fm utterly indifferent to both Mummy s jawing \nand Margot's moods. \n\nI love them; but only because they are Mummy and Mar- \ngot. With Daddy it's different. If he holds Margot up as \nan example, approves of what she does, praises and caresses \nher, then something gnaws at me inside, because I adore \nDaddy. He is the one I look up to. I don't love anyone in \nthe world but him. He doesn't notice that he treats Margot \ndifferently from me. Now Margot is just the prettiest, sweet- \nest, most beautiful girl in the world. But all the same I feel \nI have some right to be taken seriously too. I have always \nbeen the dunce, the ne'er-do-well of the family, I've always \nhad to pay double for my deeds, first with the scolding and \nthen again because of the way my feelings are hurt. Now I'm \nnot satisfied with this apparent favoritism any more. I want \nsomething from Daddy that he is not able to give me. \n\nI'm not jealous of Margot, never have been. I don't envy \nher good looks or her beauty. It is only that I long for Daddy’s \nreal love: not only as his child, but for me— Anne, myself. \n\nI cling to Daddy because it is only through him that I \nam able to Tetain the remnant of family feeling. Daddy \ndoesn’t understand that I need to give vent to my feelings \nover Mummy sometimes. He doesn’t want to talk about it; \nhe simply avoids anything which might lead to remarks \nabout Mummy's failings. Just the same, Mummy and her \nfailings are something I find harder to bear than anything \nelse. I don’t know how to keep it all to myself. I can’t always \nbe drawing attention to her untidiness, her sarcasm, and her \nlack of sweetness, neither can I believe that I’m always in \nthe wrong. \n\nWe are exact opposites in everything; so naturally we \nare bound to run up against each other. I don't pronounce \njudgment on Mummy’s character, for that is something I \ncan't judge. I only look at her as a mother, and she just \ndoesn't succeed in being that to me; I have to be my own \nmother. I've drawn myself apart from them all; I am my \nown skipper and later on I shall see where I come to land. \nAll this comes about particularly because I have in my mind's \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n41 \n\n\neye an image of what a perfect mother and wife should be; \nand in her whom I must call “Mother” I find no trace of \nthat image. \n\nI am always making resolutions not to notice Mummy’s \nbad example. I want to see only the good side of her and to \nseek in myself what I cannot find in her. But it doesn’t work; \nand the worst of it is that neither Daddy nor Mummy under- \nstands this gap in my life, and I blame them for it. I wonder \nif anyone can ever succeed in making their children abso- \nlutely content. \n\nSometimes I believe that God wants to try me, both now \nand later on; I must become good through my own efforts, \nwithout examples and without good advice. Then later on \nI shall be all the stronger. Who besides me will ever read \nthese letters? From whom but myself shall I get comfort? \nAs I need comforting often, I frequently feel weak, and dis- \nsatisfied with myself; my shortcomings are too great. I know \nthis, and every day I try to improve myself, again and again. \n\nMy treatment varies so much. One day Anne is so sensible \nand is allowed to know everything; and the next day I hear \nthat Anne is just a silly little goat who doesn’t know any- \nthing at all and imagines that she’s learned a wonderful \nlot from books. I’m not a baby or a spoiled darling any more, \nto be laughed at, whatever she does. I have my own views, \nplans, and ideas, though I can’t put them into words yet. \nOh, so many things bubble up inside me as I lie in bed, \nhaving to put up with people I’m fed up with, who always \nmisinterpret my intentions. That’s why in the end I always \ncome back to my diary. That is where I start and finish, be- \ncause Kitty is always patient. I’ll promise her that I shall \npersevere, in spite of everything, and find my own way \nthrough it all, and swallow my tears. I only wish I could see \nthe results already or occasionally receive encouragement from \nsomeone who loves me. \n\nDon’t condemn me; remember rather that sometimes I \ntoo can reach the bursting point. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK",

Among other things a game of Monopoly, \na razor, and a lighter. Not that he smokes much, its really \n\njust for show. w _ , \n\nThe biggest surprise came from Mr. Van Daan when, at \none o’clock, he announced that the British had landed in \nTunis, Algiers, Casablanca, and Oran. “This is the \nof the end ” everyone was saying, but Churchill, the British \nPrime Minister, who had probably heard the same thing in \nE nglan d , said: “This is not the end. It is not even the begin- \nning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. \nDo you see the difference? There is certainly reason for \noptimism. Stalingrad, the Russian town which they’ve al- \nready been defending for three months, still hasnt fallen \ninto German hands. \n\nBut to return to affairs in our secret den. I must tell you \nsomething about our food supply. As you know, we have \nsome real greedy pigs on the top floor. We get our bread \nfrom a nice baker, a friend of Koophuis. We dont get so \nmuch as we used to at home, naturally. But it s sufficient. \nFour ration cards have also been bought illegally. Their \nprice is going up all the time; it has now gone up from \ntwenty-seven florins to thirty-three. And all that for a little \nslip of printed paper! In order to have something in the \nhouse that will keep, apart from our 150 tins of vegetables, \nwe have bo ught 270 pounds of dried peas and beans. They \nare not all for us, some are for the office people. They are in \nsacks which hang on hooks in our little passage (inside the \nh idden door). Owing to the weight of the contents, a few \nstitches in the sacks hurst open. So we decided it would be \nbetter to put our winter store in the attic and Peter was given \nthe job of dragging it all up there. \n\nHe had managed to get five of the six sacks upstairs intact, \nand he was just busy pulling up number six, when the bottom \nseam of the sack split and a shower-no, a positive hailstorm \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n43 \n\n\nof brown beans came pouring down and rattled down the \nstairs. There were about fifty pounds in the sack and the noise \nwas enough to waken the dead. Downstairs they thought the \nold house with all its contents was coming down on them. \n(Thank God there were no strangers in the house.) It gave \nPeter a moment's fright. But he was soon roaring with laugh- \nter, especially when he saw me standing at the bottom of the \nstairs, like a little island in the middle of a sea of beans! I was \nentirely surrounded up to my ankles in beans. Quickly we \nstarted to pick them up. But beans are so slippery and small \nthat they seemed to roll into all the possible and impossible \ncorners and holes. Now, every time anyone goes downstairs \nthey bend down once or twice, in order to be able to present \nMrs. Van Daan with a handful of beans. \n\nI’d almost forgotten to mention that Daddy is quite better \nagain. \n\nYours, Anne \n\nP S. The news has just come over the radio that Algiers has \nfallen. Morocco, Casablanca, and Oran have been in British \nhands for several days. Now we're waiting for Tunis.",

She urged him to come as \nsoon as possible. Preferably Saturday. He thought that this \nwas rather doubtful, since he had to bring his card index up \nto date first, see to a couple of patients, and settle his ac- \ncounts. Miep came to us with this news this morning. We \nthought it was unwise of him to put it off. All these prepara- \ntions entail explanations to a number of people, whom we \nwould rather keep out of it. Miep is going to ask if he can't \nmanage to come on Saturday after all. \n\nDussel said no; now he is coming on Monday. I must say I \nthink it’s pretty crazy that he doesn’t jump at the proposal— \nwhatever it is. If he were to get picked up outside, would he \nstill be able to do his card index, settle his finances, and see to \nhis patients? Why delay then? I think it’s stupid of Daddy to \nhave given in. No other news — \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Tuesday , 17 November, 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nDussel has arrived. All went well. Miep had told him that \nhe must be at a special place in front of the Post Office at \neleven o’clock, where a man would meet him. Dussel was \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n45 \n\n\nstanding at the rendezvous dead on time. Mr. Koophuis, who \nknows Dussel too, went up to him and told him that the said \ngentleman could not come, but asked whether he would just \ngo to Miep at the office. Koophuis got into a tram and went \nback to the office, while Dussel walked in the same direction. \nAt twenty past eleven Dussel tapped at the office door. Miep \nhelped him off with his coat, so that the yellow star would not \nbe seen, and took him to the private office, where Koophuis \nengaged him in conversation until the charwoman had gone. \nThen Miep went upstairs with Dussel under the pretext that \nthe private office was needed for something, opened the \nswinging cupboard, and stepped inside before the eyes of the \ndumfounded Dussel. \n\nWe all sat around the table upstairs, waiting with coffee \nand cognac to greet the newcomer. Miep showed him into \nour sitting room first. He recognized our furniture at once, \nand had not the remotest idea that we were there, above his \nhead. When Miep told him he nearly passed out with sur- \nprise. But luckily Miep didn’t give him much time and took \nhim straight upstairs. \n\nDussel sank into a chair, speechless, and looked at us all \nfor a while, as if he had to really take it all in first. After a \nwhile he stuttered “But . . . aber, sind you not in Belgium \nthen? 1st der Militar nicht come, das Auto, the escape is sie \nnicht successful?” \n\nWe explained everything to him, that we had spread the \nstory about the soldiers and the car on purpose to put people, \nand especially the Germans, on the wrong track, should they \ntry to find us. \n\nDussel was again struck dumb by such ingenuity and, when \nhe had explored further our superpractical exquisite little \n“Secret Annexe,” he could do nothing but gaze about him in \nastonishment. \n\nWe all had lunch together. Then he had a little nap and \njoined us for tea, tidied up his things a bit (Miep had brought \nthem beforehand), and began to feel more at home. Espe- \ncially when he received the following typed “Secret Annexe \nRules” (Van Daan product). \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\nPROSPECTUS AND GUIDE TO THE “SECRET ANNEXE* \n\n\n46 \n\n\nSpecial institution as temporary residence \nfor Jews and suchlike \n\nOpen all the year round. Beautiful, quiet, free from woodland \nsurroundings, m the heart of Amsterdam. Can be reached \nby trams 13 and 17, also by car or bicycle. In special cases \nalso on foot, if the Germans prevent the use of transport. \n\nBoard and lodging: Free. \n\nSpecial fat-free diet. \n\nRunning water in the bathroom (alas, no bath) and down various \ninside and outside walls. \n\nAmple storage room for all types of goods. \n\nOwn radio center , direct communication with London, New \nYork, Tel Aviv, and numerous other stations. This ap- \npliance is only for residents’ use after six o’clock m the eve- \nning No stations are forbidden, on the understanding that \nGerman stations are only listened to in special cases, such \nas classical music and the like. \n\nRest houis: 10 o’clock in the evening until 7:30 in the morning. \n10*15 on Sundays. Residents may rest during the day, con- \nditions permitting, as the directors indicate For reasons of \npublic security rest hours must be strictly observed! I \n\nHolidays (outside the home): postponed indefinitely. \n\nUse of language . Speak softly at all times, by order!

        "original_text": "Thursday , 19 November ■, 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nDussel is a very nice man, just as we had all imagined. Of \ncourse he thought it was all right to share my little room. \n\nQuite honestly Fm not so keen that a stranger should use \nmy things, but one must be prepared to make some sacrifices \nfor a good cause, so I shall make my little offering with a good \nwill. \"If we can save someone, then everything else is of sec- \nondary importance,” says Daddy, and he's absolutely right. \n\nThe first day that Dussel was here, he immediately asked \nme all sorts of questions: When does the charwoman come? \nWhen can one use the bathroom? When is one allowed to \nuse the lavatory? You may laugh, but these things are not so \nsimple in a hiding place. During the day we mustn't make \nany noise that might be heard downstairs; and if there is some \nstranger-such as the charwoman for example— then we have \nto be extra careful. I explained all this carefully to Dussel. \nBut one thing amazed me; he is very slow on the uptake. He \nasks everything twice over and still doesn’t seem to remem- \nber. Perhaps that will wear off in time, and its only that he's \nthoroughly upset by the sudden change. \n\nApart from that, all goes well. Dussel has told us a lot \nabout the outside world, which we have missed for so long \nnow. He had very sad news. Countless friends and acquaint- \nances have gone to a terrible fate. Evening after evening the \ngreen and gray army lorries trundle past. The Germans ring \nat every front door to inquire if there are any Jews living in \nthe house. If there are, then the whole family has to go at \nonce If they don’t find any, they go on to the next house. No \none has a chance of evading them unless one goes into hid- \ning. Often they go around with lists, and only ring when they \nknow they can get a good haul. Sometimes they let them off \nfor cash— so much per head. It seems like the slave hunts of \nolden times. But it’s certainly no joke; it’s much too tragic \nfor that. In the evenings when it’s dark, I often see rows of \ngood, innocent people accompanied by crying children, walk- \ning on and on, in charge of a couple of these chaps, bullied \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n48 \n\n\nand knocked about until they almost drop. No on© is spared \n—old people, babies, expectant mothers, the sick— each and \nall join in the march of death. \n\nHow fortunate we are here, so well cared for and undis- \nturbed. We wouldn't have to worry about all this misery were \nit not that we are so anxious about all those dear to us whom \nwe can no longer help. \n\nI feel wicked sleeping in a warm bed, while my dearest \nfriends have been knocked down or have fallen into a gutter \nsomewhere out in the cold night. I get frightened when I \nthink of close friends who have now been delivered into the \nhands of the crudest brutes that walk the earth. And all be- \ncause they are Jewsl \n\nYours, Anne",

The news about \nthe Jews had not really penetrated through to us until now, \nand we thought it best to remain as cheerful as possible. \nEvery now and then, when Miep lets out something about \nwhat has happened to a friend, Mummy and Mrs. Van Daan \nalways begin to cry, so Miep thinks it better not to tell us any \nmore. But Dussel was immediately plied with questions from \nall sides, and the stories he told us were so gruesome and \ndreadful that one can’t get them out of one’s mind. \n\nYet we shall still have our jokes and tease each other, when \nthese horrors have faded a bit in our minds. It won’t do us \nany good, or help those outside, to go on being as gloomy as \nwe are at the moment. And what would be the object of mak- \ning our “Secret Annexe” into a “Secret Annexe of Gloom”? \nMust I keep thinking about those other people, whatever I \nam doing? And if I want to laugh about something, should I \nstop myself quickly and feel ashamed that I am cheerful? \nOught I then to cry the whole day long? No, that I can’t do. \nBesides, in time this gloom will wear off. \n\nAdded to this misery there is another, but of a purely per- \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n49 \n\n\nsonal kind; and it pales into insignificance beside all the \nwretchedness I’ve just told you about. Still, I can't refrain \nfrom telling you that lately I have begun to feel deserted. I \nam surrounded by too great a void. I never used to feel like \nthis, my fun and amusements, and my girl friends, completely \nfilled my thoughts. Now I either think about unhappy things, \nor about myself. And at long last I have made the discovery \nthat Daddy, although he’s such a darling, still cannot take \nthe place of my entire little world of bygone days. But why \ndo I bother you with such foolish things? I’m very ungrate- \nful, Kitty; I know that. But it often makes my head swim if \nI’m jumped upon too much, and then on top of that have to \nthink about all those other miseries! \n\nYours, Anne",

No light for a fortnight; a pleasant thought, that, but \nwho knows, perhaps it won’t happen after all! It’s too dark to \nread in the afternoons after four or half past. We pass the \ntime in all sorts of crazy ways: asking riddles, physical train- \ning in the dark, talking English and French, criticizing books. \nBut it all begins to pall in the end. Yesterday evening I dis- \ncovered something new: to peer through a powerful pair of \nfield glasses into the lighted rooms of the houses at the back. \nIn the daytime we can’t allow even as much as a centimeter’s \nchink to appear between our curtains, but it can’t do any \nharm after dark. I never knew before that neighbors could he \nsuch interesting people. At any rate, ours are. I found one \ncouple having a meal, one family was in the act of taking a \nhome movie; and the dentist opposite was just attending to \nan old lady, who was awfully scared. \n\nIt was always said about Mr. Dussel that he could get on \nwonderfully with children and that he loved them all. Now \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n50 \n\n\nhe shows himself in his true colors; a stodgy, old-fashioned \ndisciplinarian, and preacher of long, drawn-out sermons on \nmanners. \n\nAs I have the unusual good fortune (!) to share my bed- \nroom— alas, a small one— with His Lordship, and as Fm gen- \nerally considered to be the most badly behaved of the three \nyoung people, I have a lot to put up with and have to pretend \nto be deaf in order to escape the old, much-repeated tickings- \noff and warnings. All this wouldn’t be too bad, if he wasn’t \nsuch a frightful sneak and he didn’t pick on Mummy of all \npeople to sneak to every time. When I’ve already just had a \ndose from him, Mummy goes over it all again, so I get a gale \naft as well as fore. Then, if I’m really lucky, I’m called on to \ngive an account of myself to Mrs. Van Daan and then I get \na veritable hurricane! \n\nHonestly, you needn’t think it’s easy to be the “badly \nbrought-up” central figure of a hypercritical family m hiding. \nWhen I lie in bed at night and think over the many sms and \nshortcomings attributed to me, I get so confused by it all that \nI either laugh or cry: it depends what sort of mood I am m. \n\nThen I fall asleep with a stupid feeling of wishing to be \ndifferent from what I am or from what I want to be; peihaps \nto behave differently from the way I want to behave, or do \nbehave. Oh, heavens above, now I’m getting you m a muddle \ntoo. Forgive me, but I don’t like crossing Sungs out, and in \nthese days of paper shortage we are not allowed to throw \npaper away. Therefore I can only advise you not to read the \nlast sentence again, and certainly not to try to understand it, \nbecause you won’t succeed anyhow! \n\nYours, Anne",

We didn’t make much fuss \nabout Chanuka: we just gave each other a few little presents \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n51 \n\n\nand then we had the candles. Because of the shortage of \ncandles we only had them alight for ten minutes, but it is all \nright as long as you have the song, Mr. Van Daan has made a \n, wooden candlestick, so that too was all properly arranged. \n\nSaturday, the evening of St. Nicholas Day, was much more \nfun. Miep and Elli had made us very inquisitive by whisper- \ning all the time with Daddy, so naturally we guessed that \nsomething was on. \n\nAnd so it was. At eight o’clock we all filed down the \nwooden staircase through the passage in pitch-darkness (it \nmade me shudder and wish that I was safely upstairs again) \ninto the little dark room. There, as there are no windows, we \nwere able to turn on a light. When that was done, Daddy \nopened the big cupboard. “Oh! how lovely,” we all cried. A \nlarge basket decorated with St. Nicholas paper stood in the \ncomer and on top there was a mask of Black Peter, \n\nWe quickly took the basket upstairs with us. There was a \nnice little present for everyone, with a suitable poem at- \ntached. I got a doll, whose skirt is a bag for odds and ends; \nDaddy got book ends, and so on. In any case it was a nice idea \nand as none of us had ever celebrated St. Nicholas, it was a \ngood way of starting. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 10 December , 1942 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMr. Van Daan used to be in the meat, sausage, and spice \nbusiness. It was because of his knowledge of this trade that \nhe was taken on in Daddy’s business. Now he is showing the \nsausagy side of himself, which, for us, is by no means dis- \nagreeable. \n\nWe had ordered a lot of meat (under the counter, of \ncourse) for preserving in case we should come upon hard \ntimes. It was fun to watch, first the way the pieces of meat \nwent through the mincer, two or three times, then how all the \naccompanying ingredients were mixed with the minced meat, \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n52 \n\n\nand then how the intestine was filled by means of a spout, to \nmake the sausages. We fried the sausage meat and ate it with \nsauerkraut for supper that evening, but the Gelderland sau- \nsages had to be thoroughly dried first, so we hung them \nover a stick tied to the ceiling with string. Everyone who \ncame into the room began to laugh when they caught a \nglimpse of the row of sausages on show. They looked terribly \nfunnyl \n\nThe room was in a glorious mess. Mr. Van Daan was wear- \ning one of his wife's aprons swathed round his substantial \nperson (he looked fatter than he is!) and was busy with the \nmeat. Hands smothered in blood, red face, and the soiled \napron, made him look like a butcher. Mrs. Van Daan was \ntrying to do everything at once, learning Dutch from a book, \nstirring the soup, watching the meat being done, sighing and \ncomplaining about her injured rib. That's what happens to \nelderly ladies (!) who do such idiotic exercises to reduce their \nlarge behinds! \n\nDussel had inflammation in one eye and was bathing it \nwith camomile tea by the fire. Pirn, who was sitting on a chair \nin a beam of sunlight that shone through the window, kept \nbeing pushed from one side to the other. In addition, I think \nhis rheumatism was bothering him, because he sat rather \nhunched up with a miserable look on his face, watching Mr. \nVan Daan at work. He looked exactly like some shriveled-up \nold man from an old people’s home. Peter was doing acro- \nbatics round the room with his cat. Mummy, Margot, and I \nwere peeling potatoes; and, of course, all of us were doing \neverything wrong because we were so busy watching Mr. \nVan Daan. \n\nDussel has opened his dental practice. For the fun of it, I \nmust tell you about his first patient. Mummy was iron- \ning; and Mrs. Van Daan was the first to face the ordeal. She \nwent and sat on a chair in the middle of the room. Dussel \nbegan to unpack his case in an awfully important way, asked \nfor some eau de cologne as a disinfectant and vaseline to take \nthe place of wax. \n\nHe looked in Mrs. Van Daan’s mouth and found two teeth \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n53 \n\n\nwhich, when touched, just made her crumple up as if she was \ngoing to pass out, uttering incoherent cries of pain, After a \nlengthy examination (in Mrs. Van Daan’s case, lasting in \nactual fact not more than two minutes) Dussel began to \nscrape away at one of the holes. But, no fear~it was out of \nthe question— the patient flung her aims and legs about \nwildly in all directions until at one point Dussel let go of the \nscraper— that remained stuck in Mrs. Van Daan’s tooth. \n\nThen the fat was really in the fire! She cried (as far as it \nwas possible with such an instrument in one’s mouth), tried \nto pull the thing out of her mouth, and only succeeded in \npushing it further in. Mr. Dussel stood with his hands against \nhis sides calmly watching the little comedy. The rest of the \naudience lost all control and roared with laughter. It was \nrotten of us, because I for one am quite sure that I should \nhave screamed even louder. After much turning, kicking, \nscreaming, and calling out, she got the instrument free at last \nand Mr. Dussel went on with his work, as if nothing had hap- \npened! \n\nThis he did so quickly that Mrs. Van Daan didn’t have \ntime to start any fresh tricks. But he’d never had so much \nhelp in all his life before. Two assistants are pretty useful: \nVan Daan and I performed our duties well. The whole scene \nlooked like, a picture from the Middle Ages entitled “A \nQuack at Work.” In the meantime, however, the patient \nhadn’t much patience; she had to keep an eye on “her” soup \nand “her” meal. One tiring is certain. Mrs. Van Daan won’t \nbe in such a hurry to allow herself to be treated again! \n\nYours, Anne",

Real slum kids with running \nnoses. I can hardly understand a word they say. \n\nYesterday afternoon Margot and I were having a bath here \nand I said, \"Supposing we were to take the children who are \nwalking past, one by one, hoist them up with a fishing rod, \ngive them each a bath, wash and mend their clothes, and then \nlet them go again, then . . .” Margot interrupted me, \"By \ntomorrow they would look just as filthy and ragged as before.” \n\nBut I’m just talking nonsense; besides, there are other \nthings to see— cars, boats, and rain. I like particularly the \nscreech of the trams as they go by. \n\nThere is no more variety in our thoughts than there is for \nourselves. They go round and round like a roundabout-from \nJews to food and from food to politics. By the way, talking \nof Jews, I saw two Jews through the curtain yesterday. I \ncould hardly believe my eyes; it was a horrible feeling, just as \nif I’d betrayed them and was now watching them in their \nmisery. There is a houseboat immediately opposite, where a \nbargeman lives with his family. He has a small yapping dog. \nWe only know the little dog by his bark and Iris tail, which \nwe can see when he runs round the deck. Ugh! Now it’s \nstarted to rain and most of the people are hidden under \numbrellas. I see nothing but ramcoats and occasionally the \nback of someone’s hat. Really I don’t need to see more. I’m \ngradually getting to know all the women at a glance, blown \nout with potatoes, wearing a red or a green coat, trodden- \ndown heels and with a bag under their arms. Their faces \neither look grim or kind-depending on their husbands’ dis- \npositions. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n55",

It says half a pound in the newspapers, but that’s \nonly for the lucky mortals who get their ration books from \nthe government, not for Jews who have gone into hiding, who \ncan only afford to buy four illegal ration books, instead of \neight. \n\nWe are all going to bake something with our butter. I \nmade some biscuits and two cakes this morning. Everyone is \nvery busy upstairs and Mummy has told me I must not go \nthere to work or read, until the household jobs are done. \n\nMrs. Van Daan is in bed with her bruised rib, complains \nthe whole day long, allows herself to be given fresh dressings \nall the time, and isn’t satisfied with anything. I shall be glad \nwhen she’s on her feet again and tidies up her own things, be- \ncause I must say this for her; she’s exceptionally industrious \nand tidy, all the while she is healthy in mind and body. She \nis cheerful too. \n\nJust as if I didn’t hear enough “ssh-ssh” during the day, for \nmaking too much noise, my gentleman bedroom companion \nnow repeatedly calls out “ssh-ssh” to me at night too. Accord- \ning to him, I am not even allowed to turn over! I refuse to \ntake the slightest notice of him, and shall go “ssh-ssh” back \nat him the next time. \n\nHe makes me furious, on Sundays especially, when he turns \nthe light on early to do his exercises. It seems to take simply \nhours, while I, poor tormented creature, feel the chairs, which \nare placed at the head of my bed to lengthen it, slide back- \nwards and forwards continually under my sleepy head. When \nhe has ended with a couple of violent arm-waving exercises \nto loosen his muscles, His Lordship begins his toilet. His \npants are hanging up, so to and fro he must go to collect \nthem. But he forgets his tie, which is lying on the table. \nTherefore once more he pushes and bumps past the chairs \nto get it. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n56 \n\n\nBut I won’t bore you any longer on the subject of old men. \nIt won’t make things any better and all my plans of revenge \n(such as disconnecting the lamp, shutting die door, hiding \nhis clothes) must be abandoned in order to keep the peace. \nOh, Im becoming so sensible] One must apply one’s reason \nto everything here, learning to obey, to hold your tongue, to \nhelp, to be good, to give in, and I don’t know what else. I’m \nafraid I shall use up all my brains too quickly, and I haven’t \ngot so very many. Then I shall not have any left for when the \nwar is over. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nWednesday , IS January , 194S \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nEverything has upset me again this morning, so I wasn’t \nable to finish a single thing properly. \n\nIt is terrible outside. Day and night more of those poor \nmiserable people are being dragged off, with nothing but a \nrucksack and a little money. On the way they are deprived \neven of these possessions. Families are tom apart, the men, \nwomen, and children all being separated. Children coming \nhome from school find that their parents have disappeared. \nWomen return from shopping to find their homes shut up \nand their families gone. \n\nThe Dutch people are anxious too, their sons are being sent \nto Germany. Everyone is afraid. \n\nAnd every night hundreds of planes fly over Holland and \ngo to German towns, where the earth is plowed up by their \nbombs, and every hour hundreds and thousands of people are \nkilled in Russia and Africa. No one is able to keep out of it, \nthe whole globe is waging war and although it is going better \nfor the Allies, the end is not yet in sight. \n\nAnd as for us, we are fortunate. Yes, we are luckier than \nmillions of people. It is quiet and safe here, and we are, so to \nspeak, living on capital We are even so selfish as to talk about \n\"after the war,” brighten up at the thought of having new \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n57 \n\n\nclothes and new shoes, whereas we really ought to save every \npenny, to help other people, and save what is left from the \nwreckage after the war. \n\nThe children here run about in just a thin blouse and clogs; \nno coat, no hat, no stockings, and no one helps them. Their \ntummies are empty, they chew an old carrot to stay the pangs, \ngo from their cold homes out into the cold street and, when \nthey get to school, find themselves in an even colder class- \nroom. Yes, it has even got so bad in Holland that countless \nchildren stop the passers-by and beg for a piece of bread. I \ncould go on for hours about all the suffering the war has \nbrought, but then I would only make myself more dejected. \nThere is nothing we can do but wait as calmly as we can till \nthe misery comes to an end. Jews and Christians wait, the \nwhole earth waits; and there are many who wait for death. \n\nYours, Anne",

I’d like to \nstamp my feet, scream, give Mummy a good shaking, cry, and \nI don’t know what else, because of the horrible words, mock- \ning looks, and accusations which are leveled at me repeatedly \nevery day, and find their mark, like shafts from a tightly \nstrung bow, and which are just as hard to draw from my \nbody. \n\nI would like to shout to Margot, Van Daan, Dussel— and \nDaddy too— “Leave me in peace, let me sleep one night at \nleast without my pillow being wet with tears, my eyes burn- \ning and my head throbbing. Let me get away from it all, \npreferably away from the world!” But I can’t do that, they \nmustn’t lmow my despair, I can’t let them see the wounds \nwhich they have caused, I couldn’t bear their sympathy and \ntheir kindhearted jokes, it would only make me want to \nscream all the more. If I talk, everyone thinks I’m showing \noff; when I’m silent they think I’m ridiculous; rude if I an- \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n58 \n\n\nswer, sly if I get a good idea, lazy if Fm tired, selfish if I eat a \nmouthful more than I should, stupid, cowardly, crafty, etc., \netc. The whole day long I hear nothing else but that I am an \ninsufferable baby, and although I laugh about it and pretend \nnot to take any notice, I do mind. I would like to ask God \nto give me a different nature, so that I didn't put everyone's \nback up. But that can't be done. Fve got the nature that has \nbeen given to me and Fm sure it can't be bad. I do my very \nbest to please everybody, far more than they'd ever guess. I \ntry to laugh it all off, because I don’t want to let them see my \ntrouble. More than once, after a whole string of undeserved \nrebukes, I have flared up at Mummy: “I don't care what you \nsay anyhow. Leave me alone: Fm a hopeless case anyway.” \nNaturally, I was then told I was rude and was virtually \nignored for two days; and then, all at once, it was quite for- \ngotten, and I was treated like everyone else again. It is im- \npossible for me to be all sugar one day and spit venom the \nnext. Fd rather choose the golden mean (which is not so \ngolden), keep my thoughts to myself, and try for once to be \njust as disdainful to them as they are to me. Oh, if only I \ncould! \n\nYours, Anne",

The discord, long ac- \ncepted by us, struck Mr. Dussel as a calamity at first. But he \nis getting used to it now and tries not to think about it. \nMargot and Peter aren't a bit what you would call \"young,” \nthey are both so staid and quiet. I show up terribly against \nthem and am always hearing, \"You don't find Margot and \nPeter doing that— why don’t you follow their example?” I \nsimply loathe it. I might tell you 1 don't want to be in the \nleast like Margot. She is much too soft and passive for my \nliking and allows everyone to talk her around, and gives in \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n59 \n\n\nabout everything. I want to be a stronger character! But I \nkeep such ideas to myself: they would only laugh at me, if I \ncame along with this as an explanation of my attitude. The \natmosphere at table is usually strained, though luckily the \noutbursts are sometimes checked by \"the soup eaters”! The \n“soup eaters” are the people from the office who come in and \nare served with a cup of soup. This afternoon Mr. Van Daan \nwas talking about Margot eating so little again, \"I suppose \nyou do it to keep slim,” he added, teasing her. Mummy, who \nalways defends Margot, said loudly: “I can't bear your stupid \nchatter any longer.” Mr. Van Daan turned scarlet, looked \nstraight in front of him, and said nothing. We often laugh \nabout things; just recently Mrs. Van Daan came out with \nsome perfect nonsense. She was recalling the past, how well \nshe and her father got on together and what a flirt she was. \n“And do you know,” she went on, “if a man gets a bit aggres- \nsive, my father used to say, then you must say to him, ‘Mr. \nSo and So, remember I am a lady!' and he will know what you \nmean.” We thought that was a good joke and burst out laugh- \ning. Peter too, although usually so quiet, sometimes gives \ncause for mirth. He is blessed with a passion for foreign \nwords, although he does not always know their meaning. On© \nafternoon we couldn't go to the lavatory because there were \nvisitors in the office; however, Peter had to pay an urgent call. \nSo he didn't pull the plug. He put a notice up on the lava- \ntory door to warn us, with “S.V.P. gas” on it. Of course he \nmeant to put “Beware of gas”; but he thought the other \nlooked more genteel. He hadn’t got the faintest notion it \nmeant “if you please.” \n\nYours, Anne",

No one else but Petronella. \n\nHenk brought a copy of the bishop’s letter to churchgoers \nfor us to read.

Will it help? It won’t help the \npeople of our religion. \n\nYou’d never guess what has happened to us now. The \nowner of these premises has sold the house without informing \nKraler and Koophuis. One morning the new owner arrived \nwith an architect to have a look at the house. Luckily, Mr. \nKoophuis was present and showed the gentlemen everything \nexcept the \"Secret Annexe.” He professed to have forgotten \nthe key of the communicating door. The new owner didn’t \nquestion any further. It will be all right as long as he doesn’t \ncome back and want to see the “Secret Annexe,” because then \nit won’t look too good for us. \n\nDaddy has emptied a card index box for Margot and me, \nand put cards in it. It is to be a book card system; then we \nboth write down which books we have read, who they are by, \netc I have procured another little notebook for foreign words. \n\nLately Mummy and I have been getting on better together, \nbut we still never confide in each other.

        "original_text": "Wednesday , 10 March, 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nWe Rad a short circuit last evening, and on top of that the \nguns kept banging away all the time. I still haven't got over \nmy fear of everything connected with shooting and planes, \nand I creep into Daddy's bed nearly every night for comfort. \nI know it's very childish but you don't know what it is like. \nThe A.A. guns roar so loudly that you cant hear yourself \nspeak. Mrs. Van Daan, the fatalist, was nearly crying, and \nsaid in a very timid little voice, “Oh, it is so unpleasant! Oh, \nthey are shooting so hard,” by which she really means Tm so \nfrightened.” \n\nIt didn't seem nearly so bad by candlelight as in the dark. \nI was shivering, just as if I had a temperature, and begged \nDaddy to light the candle again. He was relentless, the light \nremained off. Suddenly there was a burst of machine-gun fire, \nand that is ten times worse than guns. Mummy jumped out of \nbed and, to Pirn's annoyance, lit the candle. When he com- \nplained her answer was firm: “After all, Anne's not exactly a \nveteran soldier.” And that was the end of it. \n\nHave I already told you about Mrs. Van Daan's other fears? \nI don't think so. If I am to keep you informed of all that hap- \npens in the “Secret Annexe,” you must know about this too. \nOne night Mrs. Van Daan thought she heard burglars in the \nattic; she heard loud footsteps and was so frightened that she \nwoke her husband. Just at that moment the burglars disap- \npeared and the only sounds that Mr. Van Daan could hear \nwere the heartbeats of the frightened fatalist herself. “Oh, \nPutti [Mr. Van Daan's nickname], they are sure to have taken \nthe sausages and all our peas and beans. And Peter, I wonder \nif he is still safely in bed?” “They certainly won't have stolen \nPeter. Listen, don’t worry and let me go to sleep.” But nothing \ncame of that. Mrs. Van Daan was far too nervous to sleep an- \nother wink. A few nights after that the whole Van Daan fam- \nily was woken by ghostly sounds. Peter went up to the attic \nwith a torch— and scamper-scamper! What do you think it \nwas running away? A swarm of enormous rats ? When we knew \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\nwho the thieves were, we let Mouschi sleep in the attic and \nthe uninvited guests didn't come back again; at least not dur- \ning the night. \n\nPeter went up to the loft a couple of evenings ago to fetch \nsome old newspapers. He had to hold the trap door firmly to \nget down the steps. He put his hand down without looking \n. . . and went tumbling down the ladder from the sudden \nshock and pain. Without knowing it he had put his hand on \na large rat, and it had bitten him hard. By the time he \nreached us, as white as a sheet and with his knees knocking, \nthe blood had soaked through his pajamas. And no wonder; \nit's not very pleasant to stroke a large rat; and to get bitten into \nthe bargain is really dreadful. \n\nYours, Anne",

Extra butter for the young; the problems of mod- \nem youth; Mummy defends youth in everything and after a \ncertain amount of squabbling she always gets her way. A bot- \ntle of preserved sole has gone bad; gala dinner for Mouschi \nand Boche. You haven’t met Boche yet, although she was here \nbefore we went into hiding. She is the warehouse and office \ncat and keeps down the rats in the storerooms. Her odd po- \nlitical name requires an explanation. For some time the firm \nhad two cats; one for the warehouse and one for the attic, \nNow it occasionally happened that the two cats met; and the \nresult was always a terrific fight. The aggressor was always \nthe warehouse cat; yet it was always the attic cat who man- \naged to win-just like among nations. So the storehouse cat \nwas named the German or “Roche” and the attic cat the Eng- \nlish or “Tommy.” Tommy was got rid of later; we are all en- \ntertained by Boche when we go downstairs. \n\nWe have eaten so many kidney beans and haricot beans \nthat I can’t bear the sight of them any more. The mere thought \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n63 \n\n\nof them makes me feel quite sick. Bread is no longer served \nin the evenings now. Daddy has just said that he doesn't feel \nin a good mood. His eyes look so sad again— poor soul! \n\nI can t drag myself away from a book called The Knock at \nthe Door by Ina Boudier-Bakker. The story of the family is \nexceptionally well written. Apart from that, it is about war, \nwriters, the emancipation of women; and quite honestly I'm \nnot awfully interested. \n\nHorrible air raids on Germany. Mr. Van Daan is in a bad \nmood; the cause— cigarette shortage. Discussions over the \nquestion of whether we should, or should not, use our canned \nvegetables ended in our favor. \n\nI can t get into a single pair of shoes any more, except ski \nboots, which are not much use about the house. A pair of rush \nsandals costing 6.50 florins lasted me just one week, after \nwhich they were out of action. Perhaps Miep will scrounge \nsomething under the counter. I must cut Daddy's hair. Pirn \nmaintains that he will never have another barber after the war, \nas I do the job so well. If only I didn't snip his ear so often! \n\nYours, Anne",

It was only a cabinet minister talking \nabout them soon giving up their neutrality. A newspaper in \nthe Dam 1 was crying, “Turkey on England's side.\" The news- \npapers were tom out of his hands. This is how the joyful news \n\na A square in front of the Royal Palace. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n64 \n\n\nreached us too; 500- and 1000-guilder notes have been de- \nclared no longer valid. It is a trap for black marketeers and \nsuchlike, but even more for people who have got other kinds \nof “black” money, and for people in hiding. If you wish to \nhand in a 1000-guilder note you must be able to declare, and \nprove, exactly how you got it. They may still be used to pay \ntaxes, but only until next week. Dussel has received an old- \nfashioned foot-operated dentist's drill, I expect he’ll soon give \nme a thorough check-over. The \"Fiihrer aller Germanen” has \nbeen talking to wounded soldiers. Listening-in to it was piti- \nful. Question and answer went something like this: \n\n\"My name is Heinrich Scheppel.” \n\n\"Wounded where?” \n\n“Near Stalingrad.” \n\n\"What kind of wound?” \n\n\"Two feet frozen off and a broken joint in the left arm.” \n\nThis is exactly what the frightful puppet show on the radio \nwas like. The wounded seemed to be proud of their wounds \n-the more the better. One of them felt so moved at being able \nto shake hands with the Fiihrer (that is, if he still had a \nhandl) that he could hardly get the words out of his mouth. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 25 March , 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nYesterday Mummy, Daddy, Margot, and I were sitting \npleasantly together when suddenly Peter came in and whis- \npered something in Daddy’s ear. I heard something about \"a \nbarrel fallen over in the warehouse” and \"someone fumbling \nabout at the door.” Margot had heard it too; but when Daddy \nand Peter went off immediately, she tried to calm me down a \nbit, because I was naturally as white as a sheet and very jit- \ntery. \n\nThe three of us waited in suspense. A minute or two later \nMrs. Van Daan came upstairs, she’d been listening to the \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n65 \n\n\nwireless in the private office. She told us that Pim had asked \nher to turn off the wireless and go softly upstairs. But you \nknow what that's like, if you want to be extra quiet, then each \nstep of the old stairs creaks twice as loudly. Five minutes later \nPim and Peter appeared again, white to the roots of their hair, \nand told us their experiences. \n\nThey had hidden themselves under the stairs and waited, \nwith no result at first. But suddenly, yes, I must tell you, they \nheard two loud bumps, just as if two doors were banged here \nin the house. Pim was upstairs in one leap. Peter warned Dus- \nsel first, who finally landed upstairs with a lot of fuss and \nnoise. Then we all went up in stockinged feet to the Van \nDaans on the next floor. Mr. Van Daan had a bad cold and \nhad already gone to bed, so we all drew up closely around his \nbed and whispered our suspicions to him. \n\nEach time Mr. Van Daan coughed loudly, Mrs. Van Daan \nand I were so scared that we thought we were going to have a \nfit. That went on until one of us got the bright idea of giving \nhim some codeine, which soothed the cough at once. Again \nwe waited and waited, but we heard no more and finally we \nall came to the conclusion that the thieves had taken to their \nheels when they heard footsteps in the house, which was \notherwise so silent. \n\nNow it was unfortunate that the wireless downstairs was \nstill tuned to England, and that the chairs were neatly ar- \nranged round it. If the door had been forced, and the air-raid \nwardens had noticed and warned the police, then the results \nmight have been very unpleasant. So Mr. Van Daan got up \nand put on his coat and hat and followed Daddy cautiously \ndownstairs, Peter took up the rear, armed with a large ham- \nmer in case of emergencies. The ladies upstairs (including \nMargot and me) waited in suspense, until the gentlemen re- \nappeared five minutes later and told us that all was quiet in the \nhouse. \n\nWe arranged that we would not draw any water or pull the \nplug in the lavatory. But as the excitement had affected most \nof our tummies, you can imagine what the atmosphere was \nlike when we had each paid a visit in succession. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\nWhen something like that happens, heaps of other things \nseem to come at the same time, as now. Number One was that \nthe clock at the Westertoren, which I always find so reassur- \ning, did not strike. Number Two was that, Mr. Vossen having \nleft earlier than usual the previous evening, we didn’t know \ndefinitely whether Elli had been able to get hold of the key, \nand had perhaps forgotten to shut the door. It was still eve- \nning and we were still in a state of uncertainty, although we \ncertainly did feel a bit reassured by the fact that from about \neight o’clock, when the burglar had alarmed the house, until \nhalf past ten we had not heard a sound. On further reflection \nit also seemed very unlikely to us that a thief would have \nforced open a door so early in the evening, while there were \nstill people about in the street. Moreover, one of us got the \nidea that it was possible that the caretaker of the warehouse \nnext door was still at work since, in the excitement, and with \nthe thin walls, one can easily make a mistake, and what’s \nmore, one’s imagination can play a big part at such critical \nmoments. \n\nSo we all went to bed; but none of us could get to sleep. \nDaddy as well as Mummy and Mr. Dussel were awake, and \nwithout much exaggeration I can say that I hardly slept a \nwink. This morning the men went downstairs to see whether \nthe outside door was still shut, and everything turned out to \nbe quite safe. We gave everyone a detailed description of the \nnerve-racking event. They all made fun of it, but it is easy to \nlaugh at such things afterwards. Elh was the only one who \ntook us seriously. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nSaturday , 27 March , 194S \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nWe have finished our shorthand course; now we are begin- \nning to practice speed. Aren’t we getting clever? I must tell \nyou more about my time-killing subjects (I call them such, be- \ncause we have got nothing else to do but make the days go by \n\n\n\n67 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nas quickly as possible, so that the end of our time here comes \nmore quickly); I’m mad on Mythology and especially the \nGods of Greece and Rome. They think here that it is just a \npassing craze, they’ve never heard of an adolescent kid of my \nage being interested in Mythology. Well, then, I shall be the \nfirst! \n\nMr. Van Daan has a cold, or rather he has a little tickle in \nhis throat. He makes a tremendous fuss about it Gargling \nwith camomile tea, painting his throat with tincture of myrrh, \nrubbing eucalyptus all over his chest, nose, teeth, and tongue; \nand then getting into an evil mood on top of it all. \n\nRauter, one of the German big shots, has made a speech. \n“All Jews must be out of the German-occupied countries be- \nfore July 1. Between April 1 and May 1 the province of \nUtrecht must be cleaned out [as if the Jews were cock- \nroaches]. Between May 1 and June 1 the provinces of North \nand South Holland.” These wretched people are sent to filthy \nslaughterhouses like a herd of sick, neglected cattle. But I \nwon’t talk about it, I only get nightmares from such thoughts. \n\nOne good little piece of news is that the German depart- \nment of the Labor Exchange has been set on fire by sabo- \nteurs. A few days after, the Registrar’s Office went the same \nway. Men in German police uniforms gagged the guards and \nmanaged to destroy important papers. \n\nYours, Anne",

Secondly, Elli has flu. \nThirdly, Mr. Vossen is going to the hospital next week. He \nhas probably got an abdominal ulcer. And fourthly, some im- \nportant business conferences, the mam points of which Daddy \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n68 \n\n\nhad discussed in detail with Mr. Koophuis, were due to be \nheld, but now there isn't time to explain everything thorough- \nly to Mr. Kraler. \n\nThe gentlemen who had been expected duly arrived; even \nbefore they came Daddy was trembling with anxiety as to \nhow the talks would go. \"If only I could be there, if only I was \ndownstairs,\" he cried. \"Why don't you go and lie with one ear \npressed against the floor, then you'll be able to hear every- \nthing.\" Daddy's face cleared, and at half past ten yesterday \nmorning Margot and Pim (two ears are better than one!) took \nup their positions on the floor. The talks were not finished in \nthe morning, but by the afternoon Daddy was not in a fit state \nto continue the listening campaign. He was half paralyzed \nfrom remaining in so unusual and uncomfortable a position. I \ntook his place at half past two, as soon as we heard voices in \nthe passage. Margot kept me company. The talk at times was \nso long-winded and boring that quite suddenly I fell asleep on \nthe cold hard linoleum floor. Margot did not dare to touch me \nfor fear they might hear us, and talking was out of the ques- \ntion. I slept for a good half hour and then woke with a shock, \nhaving forgotten every word of the important discussions. \nLuckily Margot had paid more attention. \n\nYours, Anne",

I was lying in bed yesterday evening waiting for Daddy \nto come and say my prayers with me, and wish me good night, \nwhen Mummy came into my room, sat on my bed, and asked \nvery nicely, \"Anne, Daddy can’t come yet, shall I say your \nprayers with you tonight?\" \"No, Mummy,” I answered. \n\nMummy got up, paused by my bed for a moment, and \nwalked slowly towards the door. Suddenly she turned around, \nand with a distorted look on her face said, \"I don't want to \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\nbe cross, love cannot be forced.” There were tears in her eyes \nas she left the room. \n\nI lay still in bed, feeling at once that I had been horrible to \npush her away so rudely. But I knew too that I couldn't have \nanswered differently. It simply wouldn't work. I felt sorry for \nMummy; very, very sorry, because I had seen for the first time \nin my life that she mmds my coldness. I saw the look of sor- \nrow on her face when she spoke of love not being forced. It is \nhard to speak the truth, and yet it is the truth: she herself has \npushed me away, her tactless remarks and her crude jokes, \nwhich I don't find at all funny, have now made me insensitive \nto any love from her side. Just as I shrink at her hard words, \nso did her heart when she realized that the love between us \nwas gone. She cried half the night and hardly slept at all. \nDaddy doesn't look at me and if he does for a second, then I \nread in his eyes the words: \"How can you be so unkind, how \ncan you bring yourself to cause your mother such sorrow?” \n\nThey expect me to apologize; but this is something I can't \napologize for because I spoke the truth and Mummy will have \nto know it sooner or later anyway. I seem, and indeed am, in- \ndifferent both to Mummy’s tears and Daddy's looks, because \nfor the first time they are both aware of something which I \nhave always felt. I can only feel sorry for Mummy, who has \nnow had to discover that I have adopted her own attitude. For \nmyself, I remain silent and aloof; and I shall not shrink from \nthe truth any longer, because the longer it is put off, the more \ndifficult it will be for them when they do hear it. \n\nYours, Anne",

Even so, later on, when \neverything is normal again, I shall be amazed to think that we, \nwho were so spick and span at home, should have sunk to such \na low level. By this I mean that our manners have declined. \nFor instance, ever since we have been here, we have had one \noilcloth on our table which, owing to so much use, is not one \nof the cleanest. Admittedly I often try to clean it with a dirty \ndishcloth, which is more hole than cloth. The table doesn't do \n\n1 Gennaa Officers* Club. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nus much credit either, in spite of hard scrubbing.

        "original_text": "Tuesday , 18 May , 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI witnessed a terrific air battle between German and British \nplanes. Unfortunately a couple of the Allies had to jump from \nburning machines. Our milkman, who lives in Halfweg, saw \nfour Canadians sitting by the roadside, one of them spoke \nfluent Dutch. He asked the milkman to give him a light for his \ncigarette, and told him that the crew had consisted of six men. \nThe pilot was burned to death, and their fifth man had hid- \nden himself somewhere. The German police came and fetched \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK 72 \n\nthe four perfectly fit men. I wonder how they managed to \nhave such clear brains after that terrifying parachute trip. \n\nAlthough it is fairly warm, we have to light our fires every \nother day, in order to bum vegetable peelings and refuse. We \ncan't put anything in the garbage pails, because we must al- \nways think of the warehouse boy. How easily one could be \nbetrayed by being a little careless! \n\nAll students who wish either to get their degrees this year, \nor continue their studies, are compelled to sign that they are \nin sympathy with the Germans and approve of the New Order. \nEighty per cent have refused to go against their consciences. \nNaturally they had to bear the consequences. All the students \nwho do not sign have to go to a labor camp in Germany What \nwill be left of the youth of the country if they have all got to \ndo hard labor in Germany? Mummy shut the window last \nnight because of all the banging; I was in Pirn's bed Suddenly \nMrs. Van Daan jumped out of bed above us, just as if Mouschi \nhad bitten her. A loud clap followed immediately. It sounded \njust as if an incendiary bomb had fallen beside my bed. I \nshrieked out, “Light, light 5 ” Pirn turned on the lamp. I ex- \npected nothing less than to see the room ablaze within a few \nminutes. Nothing happened. We all hurried upstairs to see \nwhat was going on. Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan had seen a red \nglow through the open window. He thought that there was a \nfire in the neighborhood and she thought that our house had \ncaught fire. When the clap came Mrs. Van Daan was already \non her feet with her knees knocking. But nothing more hap- \npened and we all crept back into our beds. \n\nBefore a quarter of an hour had passed the shooting started \nup again. Mrs. Van Daan sat bolt upright at once and then \nwent downstairs to Mr. Dussel's room, seeking there the rest \nwhich she could not find with her spouse. Dussel received her \nwith the words, “Come into my bed, my child!” which sent us \noff into uncontrollable laughter. The gunfire troubled us no \nlonger, our fear was banished! \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\n73 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL",

I’m worried by so many woes? \n\nThere was also a bit about food that Margot could not trans- \nlate into rhyme, so I shall leave it out. Don’t you think my \nbirthday poem is good? I have been thoroughly spoiled in \nother ways and received a lot of lovely things. Among other \nthings a fat book on my pet subject-the mythology of Greece \nand Rome. I can’t complain of a shortage of sweets either— \neveryone has broken into their last reserves.

So I shall give you the \nnews in brief. \n\nMr. Vossen has not been operated on for his duodenal ulcer. \nWhen he was on the operating table and they had opened him \nup, the doctors saw that he had cancer, which was far too ad- \nvanced to operate. So they stitched him up again, kept him in \nbed for three weeks and gave him good food, and finally sent \nhim home again. I do pity him terribly and think it is rotten \nthat we can t go out, otherwise I should certainly visit him \nfrequently to cheer him up. It is a disaster for us that good old \nVossen won't be able to keep us in touch with all that goes on, \nand all he hears in the warehouse. He was our best helper and \nsecurity adviser; we miss him very much indeed. \n\nIt will be our turn to hand in our radio next month. Koophuis \nhas a clandestine baby set at home that he will let us have to \ntake the place of our big Phillips. It certainly is a shame to \nhave to hand in our lovely set, but in a house where people \nare hiding, one daren't, under any circumstances, take wanton \nrisks and so draw the attention of the authorities. We shall \nhave the little radio upstairs. On top of hidden Jews, clandes- \ntine money and clandestine buying, we can add a clandestine \nradio. Everyone is trying to get hold of an old set and to hand \nthat in instead of their “source of courage.\" It is really true \nthat as the news from outside gets worse, so the radio with its \nmiraculous voice helps us to keep up our morale and to say \nagain, “Chins up, stick it out, better times will come!\" \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n75",

        "original_text": "Sunday , 11 July , 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nTo return to the \"upbringing” theme for the umpteenth \ntime, I must tell you that I really am frying to be helpful, \nfriendly, and good, and to do everything I can so that the rain \nof rebukes dies down to a light summer drizzle. It is mighty \ndifficult to be on such model behavior with people you can't \nbear, especially when you don’t mean a word of it. But I do \nreally see that I get on better by shamming a bit, instead of \nmy old habit of telling everyone exactly what I think (al- \nthough no one ever asked my opinion or attached the slightest \nimportance to it) . \n\nI often lose my cue and simply can’t swallow my rage at \nsome injustice, so that for four long weeks we hear nothing \nbut an everlasting chatter about the cheekiest and most \nshameless girl on earth. Don’t you think that sometimes I’ve \ncause for complaint? It’s a good thing I’m not a grouser, be- \ncause then I might get sour and bad-tempered. \n\nI have decided to let my shorthand go a bit, firstly to give \nme more time for my other subjects and secondly because of \nmy eyes. I’m so miserable and wretched as I’ve become very \nshortsighted and ought to have had glasses for a long time al- \nready (phew, what an owl I shall look!) but you know, of \ncourse, in hiding one cannot. Yesterday everyone talked of \nnothing but Anne’s eyes, because Mummy had suggested \nsending me to the oculist with Mrs. Koophuis. I shook in my \nshoes somewhat at this announcement, for it is no small thing \nto do. Go out of doors, imagine it, in the street— doesn’t bear \nthinking about! I was petrified at first, then glad. But it doesn’t \ngo as easily as that, because all the people who would have to \napprove such a step could not reach an agreement quickly. All \nthe difficulties and risks had first to be carefully weighed, al- \nthough Miep would have gone with me straight away. \n\nIn the meantime I got out my gray coat from the cupboard, \nbut it was so small that it looked as if it belonged to my \nyounger sister. \n\nI am really curious to know what will come of it all, but I \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n76 \n\n\ndon t think the plan will come off because the British have \nlanded in Sicily now and Daddy is once again hoping for a \n\"quick finish.” \n\nElli gives Margot and me a lot of office work; it makes us \nboth feel quite important and is a great help to her. Anyone \ncan file away correspondence and write in the sales book, but \nwe take special pains. \n\nMiep is just like a pack mule, she fetches and carries so \nmuch. Almost every day she manages to get hold of some \nvegetables for us and brings everything in shopping bags on \nher bicycle. We always long for Saturdays when our books \ncome. Just like little children receiving a present. \n\nOrdinary people simply don’t know what books mean to us, \nshut up here. Reading, learning, and the radio are our amuse- \nments. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Tuesday, 13 July, 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nYesterday afternoon, with Daddy’s permission, I asked Dus- \nsel whether he would please be so good (being really very \npolite) as to allow me to use the little table in our room twice \na week in the afternoons, from four o’clock till half past five. \nI sit there every day from half past two till four, while Dussel \nsleeps, but otherwise the room plus table are out of bounds. \nInside, in our common room, there is much too much going \non, it is impossible to work there, and besides, Daddy likes to \nsit at the writing table and work too sometimes. \n\nSo it was quite a reasonable request, and the question was \nput very politely. Now honestly what do you think the very \nlearned Dussel replied: \"No.” Just plain \"No! I was indignant \nand refused to be put off like that, so I asked him the reason \nfor his \"No.” But I was sent away with a flea in my ear. This \nwas the barrage which followed: \n\n“I have to work too, and if I can’t work in the afternoons, \nthen there is no time left for me at all. I must finish my task, \n\n\n\n77 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\notherwise I’ve started it all for nothing. Anyway, you don't \nwork seriously at anything. Your mythology, now just what \nkind of work is that; knitting and reading are not work either. \nI am at the table and shall stay there.” My reply was: \n\n“Mr. Dussel, I do work seriously and there is nowhere else \nfor me to work in the afternoons. I beg of you to kindly re- \nconsider my request!” \n\nWith these words the offended Anne turned her back on \nthe very learned doctor, ignoring him completely. I was seedl- \ning with rage, and thought Dussel frightfully rude (which he \ncertainly was) and myself very friendly. In the evening when \nI could get hold of Pirn, I told him how it had gone off and \ndiscussed what I should do next, because I was not going to \ngive in, and preferred to clear it up myself. Pim told me how \nI ought to tackle the problem, but warned me that it would \nbe better to leave it till the next day, as I was so het up. I let \nthis advice go to the winds, and waited for Dussel after the \ndishes were done. Pim sat in the room next to us, which had a \ncalming influence on me. I began: “Mr. Dussel, I don't sup- \npose you see any point in discussing the matter any more, but \nI must ask you to do so.” Dussel then remarked with his \nsweetest smile: “I am always, and at all times, prepared to \ndiscuss this matter, but it has already been settled.” \n\nI went on talking, though continually interrupted by \nDussel. “When you first came here we arranged that this \nroom should be for both of us; if we were to divide it fairly, \nyou would have the morning and I all the afternoon! Rut I \ndon't even ask that much, and I think that my two afternoons \nare really perfectly reasonable.” At this Dussel jumped up as \nif someone had stuck a needle into him. “You can't talk \nabout your rights here at all. And where am I to go, then? \nI shall ask Mr. Van Daan whether he will build a little com- \npartment in the attic, then I can go and sit there. I simply \ncan't work anywhere. With you one always gets trouble. If \nyour sister Margot, who after all has more reason to ask such \na thing, would have come to me with the same questions, I \nshould not think of refusing, but you . . .” Then followed \nthe business about the mythology and the knitting, and Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n78 \n\n\nwas insulted again. However, she did not show it and let \nDussel finish speaking: \"But you, one simply cant talk to \nyou. You are so outrageously selfish, as long as you can get \nwhat you want, you don’t mind pushing everyone else to one \nside, I’ve never seen such a child. But after all, I suppose I \nshall be obliged to give you your own way, because otherwise \nI shall be told later on that Anne Frank failed her exam \nbecause Mr. Dussel would not give up the table for her.” \n\nIt went on and on and finally it was such a torrent I could \nhardly keep pace with it. At one moment I thought, “In a \nminute I’ll give him such a smack in the face that he’ll fly \nup to the ceiling together with his lies,” but the next moment \nI said to myself, “Keep calm! Such a fellow isn’t worth get- \nting worked up about.” \n\nAfter giving final vent to his fury, Master Dussel left the \nroom with an expression of mixed wrath and triumph, his \ncoat stuffed with food. I dashed to Daddy and told him all \nthat he had not already heard of the story. Pim decided to \ntalk to Dussel the same evening, which he did. They talked \nfor over half an hour. The theme of the conversation was \nsomething like this: first of all they talked about whether \nAnne should sit at the table, yes or no. Daddy said that he \nand Dussel had already discussed the subject once before, \nwhen he had professed to agree with Dussel, in order not to \nput him m the wrong in front of the young. But Daddy had \nnot thought it fair then. Dussel thought that I should not \nspeak as if he was an intruder who tried to monopolize every- \nthing, hut Daddy stuck up for me firmly over that, because \nhe had heard for himself that I had not breathed a word of \nsuch a thing. \n\nTo and fro it went, Daddy defending my selfishness and \nmy “trifling” work, Dussel grumbling continually. \n\nFinally, Dussel had to give in after all, and I had the op- \nportunity of working undisturbed until five o’clock for two \nafternoons a week. Dussel looked down his nose very much, \ndidn’t speak to me for two days and still had to go and sit at \nthe table from five till half past— frightfully childish. \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 79 \n\nA person of fifty-four who is still so pedantic and small- \nminded must be so by nature, and will never improve. \n\nYours, Anne",

This morning Peter went \nto the warehouse at seven o clock as usual, and at once \nnoticed that both the warehouse door and the door opening \non to the street were ajar. He told Pirn, who tuned the radio \nin the private office to Germany and locked the door. Then \nthey went upstairs together. \n\nThe standing orders for such times were observed as usual: \nno taps to be turned on; therefore, no washing, silence, every- \nthing to be finished by eight o'clock and no lavatory. We \nwere all very glad that we had slept so well and not heard \nanything. Not until half past eleven did we learn from Mr. \nKoophuis that the burglars had pushed in the outer door with \na crowbar and had forced the warehouse door. However, they \ndid not find much to steal, so they tried their luck upstairs. \nThey stole two cashboxes containing forty florins, postal \norders and checkbooks and then, worst of all, all the coupons \nfor 150 kilos of sugar. \n\nMr. Koophuis thinks that they belonged to the same gang \nas the ones who tried all three doors six weeks ago. They were \nunsuccessful then. \n\nIt has caused rather a stir in the building, but the “Secret \nAnnexe” can’t seem to go on without sensations like this. We \nwere very glad that the typewriters and money in our ward- \nrobe, where they are brought upstairs every evening, were \nsafe. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n80",

You might really ask, does a day go by \nwithout some excitement? \n\nWe had the first warning siren while we were at breakfast, \nbut we don't give a hoot about that, it only means that the \nplanes are crossing the coast. \n\nAfter breakfast I went and lay down for an hour as I had \na bad headache, then I went downstairs. It was about two \no'clock. Margot had finished her office work at half past two; \nshe had not packed her things together when the sirens began \nto wail, so upstairs I went again with her. It was high time, \nfor we had not been upstairs five minutes when they began \nshooting hard, so much so that we went and stood in the pas- \nsage. And yes, the house rumbled and shook, and down came \nthe bombs. \n\nI clasped my \"escape bag\" close to me, more because I \nwanted to have something to hold than with an idea of \nescaping, because there's nowhere we can go. If ever we come \nto the extremity of fleeing from here, the street would be \njust as dangerous as an air raid. This one subsided after half \nan hour, but the activity in the house increased. Peter came \ndown from his lookout post in the attic, Dussel was in the \nmain office, Mrs. Van Daan felt safe in the private office, \nMr. Van Daan had been watching from the loft, and we on \nthe little landing dispersed ourselves too; I went upstairs \nto see rising above the harbor the columns of smoke Mr. \nVan Daan had told us about. Before long you could smell \nburning, and outside it looked as if a thick mist hung every- \nwhere. Although such a big fire is not a pleasant sight, luckily \nfor us it was all over, and we went about our respective tasks. \nThat evening at dinner; another air raid alarm! It was a nice \nmeal, but my hunger vanished, simply at the sound of the \nalarm. Nothing happened and three quarters of an hour \nlater it was all clear. The dishes were stacked ready to be \ndone; air-raid warning, ack-ack fire, an awful lot of planes. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n82 \n\n\n“Oh, dear me, twice in one day, that’s too much,” we all \nthought, but that didn't help at all; once again the bombs \nrained down, the other side this time, on Schiphol , 1 accord- \ning to the British. The planes dived and climbed, we heard \nthe hum of their engines and it was very gruesome. Each \nmoment I thought: “One's falling now. Here it comes.” \n\nI can assure you that when I went to bed at nine o'clock \nI couldn't hold my legs still. I woke up at the stroke of \ntwelve: planes. Dussel was undressing. I didn't let that put \nme off, and at the first shot, I leaped out of bed, wide awake. \nTwo hours with Daddy and still they kept coming. Then they \nceased firing and I was able to go to bed. I fell asleep at half \npast two. \n\nSeven o'clock. I sat up in bed with a start. Mr. Van Daan \nwas with Daddy. Burglars was my first thought. I heard Mr. \nVan Daan say “everything.” I thought that everything had \nbeen stolen. But no, this time it was wonderful news, such \nas we have not heard for months, perhaps in all the war \nyears. “Mussolini has resigned, the King of Italy has taken \nover the government.” We jumped for joy. After the terrible \nday yesterday, at last something good again and-hope. Hope \nfor it to end, hope for peace. \n\nKraler called in and told us that Fokkers has been badly \ndamaged. Meanwhile we had another air-raid alarm with \nplanes overhead and one more warning siren. I'm just about \nchoked with alarms, very tired and don’t feel a bit like work. \nBut now the suspense over Italy will awaken the hope that it \nwill soon end, perhaps even this year. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 29 July , 1948 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMrs. Van Daan, Dussel, and I were doing the dishes and \nI was extraordinarily quiet, which hardly ever happens, so \nthey would have been sure to notice. \n\n\nAmsterdam airport \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n83 \n\n\nIn order to avoid questions I quickly sought a fairly neutral \ntopic, and thought that the book Henry from the Other \nSide would meet the need. But I had made a mistake. If Mrs. \nVan Daan doesn't pounce on me, then Mr. Dussel does. This \nwas what it came to: Mr. Dussel had specially recommended \nus this book as being excellent. Margot and I thought it was \nanything but excellent The boys character was certainly \nwell drawn, but the rest-I had better gloss over that. I said \nsomething to that effect while we were washing the dishes, \nbut that brought me a packet of trouble. \n\n\"How can you understand the psychology of a man! Of \na child is not so difficult (1). You are much too young for \na book like that; why, even a man of twenty would not be \nable to grasp it.\" (Why did he so especially recommend this \nbook to Margot and me?) Now Dussel and Mrs. Van Daan \ncontinued together: “You know much too much about things \nthat are unsuitable for you, you ve been brought up all wrong. \nLater on, when you are older, you won t enjoy anything, \nthen you'll say: T read that in books twenty years ago/ You \nhad better make haste, if you want to get a husband or fall \nin love-or everything is sure to be a disappointment to you. \nYou are already proficient in the theory, it s only the practice \nthat you still lack!\" \n\nI suppose it's their idea of a good upbringing to always try \nto set me against my parents, because that is what they often \ndo. And to tell a girl of my age nothing about \"grown-up” \nsubjects is an equally fine methodl I see the results of that \nkind of upbringing frequently and all too clearly. \n\nI could have slapped both their faces at that moment as \nthey stood there making a fool of me. I was beside myself \nwith rage and I'm just counting the days until I'm rid of \n\"those\" people. \n\nMrs. Van Daan is a nice one! She sets a fine example . . . \nshe certainly sets one— a bad one. She is well known as being \nvery pushing, selfish, cunning, calculating, and is never con- \ntent. I can also add vanity and coquetry to the list. There \nis no question about it, she is an unspeakably disagreeable \nperson. I could write whole chapters about Madame, and \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n84 \n\n\nwho knows, perhaps I will someday. Anyone can put on a fine \ncoat of varnish outside. Mrs. Van Daan is friendly to \nstrangers and especially men, so it is easy to make a mistake \nwhen you have only known her for a short time. Mummy \nthinks she is too stupid to waste words over, Margot too \nunimportant, Pirn too ugly (literally and figuratively), and \nI, after long observation— for I was never prejudiced from the \nstart-have come to the conclusion that she is all three and \na lot more! She has so many bad qualities, why should I \neven begin about one of them? \n\nYours, Anne \n\nP.S.— Will the reader take into consideration that when \nthis story was written the writer had not cooled down from \nher fury!",

        "original_text": "Wednesday, 4 August, 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nNow that we have been in the “Secret Annexe” for over \na year, you know something of our lives, but some of it is \nquite i ndesc ribable. There is so much to tell, everything \nis so different from ordinary times and from ordinary peo- \nple's lives. But still, to give you a closer look into our lives, \nnow and again I intend to give you a description of an \nordinary day. Today Im beginning with the evening and \nnight. \n\nNine o'clock in the evening. The bustle of going to bed \nin the “Secret Annexe” begms and it is always really quite \na business. Chairs are jshoved about, beds are pulled down, \nblankets unfolded, nothing remains where it is during the \nday. I sleep on the little .divan, which is not more than one \nand a half meters long. So chairs have to be used to lengthen \nit. An eiderdown, sheets, pillows, blankets, are all fetched \nfrom Dussel's bed where they remain during the day. One \nhears terrible creaking in the next room: Margot's concertina- \nbed being pulled out. Again, divan, blankets, and pillows, \neverything is done to make the wooden slats a bit more \ncomfoi table. It sounds like thunder above, but it is only \nMrs. Van Daan’s bed. This is shifted to the window, you see, \nin order to give Her Majesty in the pink bed jacket fresh air \nto tickle her dainty nostrils I \n\nAfter Peter's finished, I step into the washing cubicle, \nwhere I give myself a thorough wash and general toilet; it \noccasionally happens (only in the hot weeks or months) \nthat there is a tiny flea floating in the water. Then teeth \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\ncleaning, hair curling, manicure, and my cotton-wool pads \nwith hydrogen peroxide (to bleach black mustache hairs)- \nall this under half an hour. \n\nHalf past nine. Quickly into dressing gown, soap in one \nhand, pottie, hairpins, pants, curlers, and cotton wool in \nthe other, I hurry out of the bathroom; but usually I’m \ncalled back once for the various hairs which decorate the \nwashbasin in graceful curves, but which are not approved of \nby the next person. \n\nTen o'clock. Put up the blackout. Good night! For at \nleast a quarter of an hour there is creaking of beds and a \nsighing of broken springs, then all is quiet, at least that is if \nour neighbors upstairs don’t quarrel in bed. \n\nHalf past eleven. The bathroom door creaks. A narrow \nstrip of light falls into the room. A squeak of shoes, a large \ncoat, even larger than the man inside it-Dussel returns \nfrom his night work in Kraler’s office. Shuffling on the floor \nfor ten minutes, crackle of paper (that is the food which has \nto be stowed away), and a bed is made. Then the form dis- \nappears again and one only hears suspicious noises from the \nlavatory from time to time. \n\nThree o'clock. I have to get up for a little job in the metal \npot under my bed, which is on a rubber mat for safety’s sake \nin case of leakage. When this has to take place, I always \nhold my breath, as it clatters into the tin like a brook from \na mountain. Then the pot is returned to its place and the \nfigure in the white nightgown, which evokes the same cry \nfrom Margot every evening: “Oh, that indecent nightdress!” \nsteps back into bed. \n\nThen a certain person lies awake for about a quarter of \nan hour, listening to the sounds of the night. Firstly, to \nwhether there might not be a burglar downstairs, then to \nthe various beds, above, next door, and in my room, from \nwhich one is usually able to make out how the various mem- \nbers of the household are sleeping, or how they pass the night \nin wakefulness. \n\nThe latter is certainly not pleasant, especially when it con- \ncerns a member of the family by the name of Dussel. First, \n\n\n\n87 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nI hear a sound like a fish gasping for breath, this is repeated \nnine or ten times, then with much ado and interchanged \nwith little smacking sounds, the lips are moistened, fol- \nlowed by a lengthy twisting and turning in bed and rear- \nranging of pillows. Five minutes 5 perfect peace and then \nthe same sequence of events unfolds itself at least three \ntimes more, after the doctor has soothed himself to sleep \nagain for a little while. It can also happen that we get a bit \nof shooting in the night, varying between one o’clock and \nfour. I never really realize it, until from habit I am already \nstanding at my bedside. Sometimes I’m so busy dreaming \nthat fm thinking about French irregular verbs or a quarrel \nupstairs. It is some time before I begin to realize that guns \nare firing and that I am still in the room. But it usually \nhappens as described above. I quickly grab a pillow and \nhandkerchief, put on my dressing gown and slippers, and \nscamper to Daddy, like Margot wrote in this birthday poem: \n\nThe first shot sounds at dead of night. \n\nHush , look! A door creab open wide , \n\nA little girl glides into sight , \n\nClasping a pillow to her side. \n\nOnce landed in the big bed, the worst is over, except if \nthe firing gets very bad. \n\nQuarter to seven. Trrrrr-the alarm clock that raises its \nvoice at any hour of the day (if one asks for it and some- \ntimes when one doesn’t). Crack-ping-Mrs. Van Daan has \nturned it off. Creak-Mr. Van Daan gets up. Puts on water \nand then full speed to the bathroom. \n\nQuarter past seven. The door creaks again. Dussel can go \nto the bathroom. Once alone, I take down the blackout- \nand a new day in the “Secret Annexe” has begun. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\nThursday , 5 August , 194S \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nToday I am going to take lunchtime. \n\nIt is half past twelve. The whole mixed crowd breathes \nagain. The warehouse boys have gone home now. Above one \ncan hear the noise of Mrs. Van Daan’s vacuum cleaner on \nher beautiful, and only, carpet. Margot goes with a few books \nunder her arm for her Dutch lesson \"for children who make \nno progress/’ because that’s Dussel’s attitude. Pim goes \ninto a comer with his inseparable Dickens to try and find \npeace somewhere. Mummy hurries upstairs to help the \nindustrious housewife, and I go to the bathroom to tidy it \nup a bit, and myself at the same time. \n\nQuarter to one. The place is filling up. First Mr. Van \nSanten, then Koophuis or Kraler, Elli and sometimes Miep \nas well. \n\nOne o'clock. We’re all sitting listening to the \nseated around the baby wireless; these are the only times when \nthe members of the \"Secret Annexe” do not interrupt each \nother, because now someone is speaking whom even Mr. \nVan Daan can’t interrupt. \n\nQuarter past one. The great share-out. Everyone from \nbelow gets a cup of soup and if there is ever a pudding, \nsome of that as well. Mr. Van Santen is happy and goes to \nsit on the divan or lean against the writing table. Newspaper, \ncup, and usually the cat, beside him. If one of the three is \nmissing he’s sure to protest. Koophuis tells us the latest \nnews from town, he is certainly an excellent source of infor- \nmation. Kraler comes helter-skelter upstairs— a short, firm \nknock on the door and in he comes rubbing his hands, ac- \ncording to his mood, in a good temper and talkative, or bad- \ntempered and quiet. \n\nQuarter to two. Everyone rises from the table and goes \nabout his own business. Margot and Mummy to the dishes. \nMr. and Mrs. Van Daan to their divan. Peter up to the attic. \nDaddy to the divan downstairs. Dussel to his bed and Anne \nto her work. Then follows the most peaceful hour; everyone \n\n\n\n89 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nis asleep, no one is disturbed. Dussel dreams of lovely food \n-the expression on his face gives this away, but I don't look \nlong because the time goes so fast and at four o’clock the \npedantic doctor is standing, clock in hand, because I’m one \nminute late in clearing the table for him. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Monday , 9 August , , 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nTo continue the \"Secret Annexe” daily timetable. I shall \nnow describe the evening meal: \n\nMr. Van Daan begins. He is first to be served, takes a \nlot of everything if it is what he likes. Usually talks at the \nsame time, always gives his opinion as the only one worth \nlistening to, and once he has spoken it is irrevocable. Be- \ncause if anyone dares to question it, then he flares up at \nonce. Oh, he can spit like a cat— I’d rather not argue, I can \ntell you— if you’ve once tried you don’t try again. He has \nthe best opinion, he knows the most about everything. All \nright then, he has got brains, but \"self-satisfaction” has \nreached a high grade with this gentleman. \n\nMadame. Really, I should remain silent. Some days, espe- \ncially if there is a bad mood coming on, you can’t look at \nher face. On closer examination, she is the guilty one in all \nthe arguments. Not the subject! Oh, no, everyone prefers to \nremain aloof over that, but one could perhaps call her the \n“kindler.” Stirring up trouble, that’s fun. Mrs. Frank against \nAnne; Margot against Daddy doesn’t go quite so easily. \n\nBut now at table, Mrs. Van Daan doesn’t go short, al- \nthough she thinks so at times. The tiniest potatoes, the sweet- \nest mouthful, the best of everything; picking over is her \nsystem. The others will get their turn, as long as I have the \nbest. Then talking. Whether anyone is interested, whether \nthey are listening or not, that doesn’t seem to matter. I \nsuppose she thinks: \"Everyone is interested in what Mrs. \nVan Daan says.” Coquettish smiles, behaving as if one knew \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n90 \n\n\neverything, giving everyone a bit of advice and encourage- \nment, that’s sure to make a good impression. But if you look \nlonger, then the good soon wears off. \n\nOne, she is industrious, two, gay, three, a coquette— and, \noccasionally, pretty. This is Petronella Van Daan. \n\nThe third table companion. One doesn’t hear much from \nhim. Young Mr. Van Daan is very quiet and doesn't draw \nmuch attention to himself. As for appetite: a Danaidean \nvessel, which is never full and after the heartiest meal declares \nquite calmly that he could have eaten double. \n\nNumber four— Margot. Eats like a little mouse and doesn’t \ntalk at all. The only things that go down are vegetables and \nfruit. \"Spoiled” is the Van Daans’ judgment; \"not enough \nfresh air and games” our opinion. \n\nBeside her-Mummy. Good appetite, very talkative. No \none has the impression, as Mrs. Van Daan: this is the house- \nwife. What is the difference? Well, Mrs. Van Daan does the \ncooking, and Mummy washes up and polishes. \n\nNumbers six and seven. I won’t say much about Daddy \nand me. The former is the most unassuming of all at table. \nHe looks first to see if everyone else has something. He needs \nnothing himself, for the best things are for the children. He \nis the perfect example, and sitting beside him, the “Secret \nAnnexe’s” \"bundle of nerves.” \n\nDr. Dussel, Helps himself, never looks up, eats and doesn't \ntalk. And if one must talk, then for heaven’s sake let it be \nabout food. You don’t quarrel about it, you only brag. Enor- \nmous helpings go down and the word “No” is never heard, \nnever when the food is good, and not often when it’s bad. \nTrousers wrapping his chest, red coat, black bedroom slippers, \nand horn-rimmed spectacles. That is how one sees him at the \nlittle table, always working, alternated only by his afternoon \nnap, food, and— his favorite spot-the lavatory. Three, four, \nfive times a day someone stands impatiently in front of the \ndoor and wriggles, hopping from one foot to the other, \nhardly able to contain himself. Does it disturb him? Not a \nbit! From quarter past seven till half past, from half past \ntwelve till one o’clock, from two till quarter past, from four \n\n\n\n91 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\ntill quarter past, from six till quarter past, and from half past \neleven until twelve. One can make a note of it— these are \nthe regular “sitting times.” He wont come off or pay any \nheed to an imploring voice at the door, giving warning of \napproaching disaster! \n\nNumber nine isn't a member of the “Secret Annexe” \nfa mil y, but rather a companion in the house and at table. \nElli has a healthy appetite. Leaves nothing on her plate and \nis not picky-and-choosy. She is easy to please and that is just \nwhat gives us pleasure. Cheerful and good-tempered, willing \nand good-natured, these are her characteristics. \n\nYours, Anne",

I talk more to myself than to the others at \nmealtimes, which is to be recommended for two reasons. \nFirstly, because everyone is happy if I don't chatter the \nwhole time, and secondly, I needn't get annoyed about other \npeople's opinions. I don’t think my opinions are stupid and \nthe others do; so it is better to keep them to myself. I do \njust the same if I have to eat something that I simply can’t \nstand. I put my plate in front of me, pretend that it is some- \nthing delicious, look at it as little as possible, and before I \n' know where I am, it is gone. When I get up in the morning, \nalso a very unpleasant process, I jump out of bed thinking \nto myself: “You’ll be back in a second,” go to the window, \ntake down the blackout, sniff at the crack of the window \nuntil I feel a bit of fresh air, and I’m awake. The bed is \nturned down as quickly as possible and then the temptation \nis removed. Do you know what Mummy calls this sort of \nthing? “The Art of Living’-that’s an odd expression. For \nthe last week we’ve all been in a bit of a muddle about time, \nbecause our dear and beloved Westertoren clock bell has \napparently been taken away for war purposes, so that neither \nby day nor night do we ever know the exact time. I still \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\nhave some hope that they will think up a substitute (tin, \ncopper or some such thing) to remind the neighborhood of \nthe clock. \n\nWhether I’m upstairs or down, or wherever I am, my \nfeet are the admiration of all, glittering in a pair of (for these \ndays) exceptionally fine shoes. Miep managed to get hold \nof them secondhand for 27.50 florins, wine-colored suede \nleather with fairly high wedge heels. I feel as if Im on stilts \nand look much taller than I am. \n\nDussel has indirectly endangered our lives. He actually \nlet Miep bring a forbidden book for him, one which abuses \nMussolini and Hitler. On the way she happened to be ran \ninto by an S.S. car. She lost her temper, shouted, “Miserable \nwretches/' and rode on. It is better not to think of what \nmight have happened if she had had to go to their head- \nquarters. \n\nYours, Anne",

Does everyone do it the \nway he does? No* “Anne, look here; I take the knife in my \nhand like this, scrape from the top downwards! No, not like \nthat — like this!” \n\n“I get on better like this, Mr. Dussel,” I remark timidly. \n\n“But still this is the best way. But du kannst take dies from \nme. Naturally I don’t care a bit, abet du must know for \nyourself.” We scrape on. I look slyly once in my neighbor s \ndirection. He shakes his head thoughtfully once more (over \nme, I suppose) but is silent. \n\n\n\n93 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nI scrape on again. Now I look to the other side, where \nDaddy is sitting; for him scraping potatoes is not just a little \nodd job, but a piece of precision work. When he reads, he \nhas a deep wrinkle at the back of his head, but if he helps \nprepare potatoes, beans, or any other vegetables, then it \nseems as if nothing else penetrates. Then he has on his \"po- \ntato face,” and he would never hand over an imperfectly \nscraped potato; it's out of the question when he makes that \nfacel \n\nI work on again and then just look up for a second; I know \nit already. Mrs. Van Daan is trying to attract Dussel’s atten- \ntion. First she looks in his direction and Dussel appears not \nto notice anything. Then she winks an eye; Dussel works on. \nThen she laughs, Dussel doesn’t look up. Then Mummy \nlaughs too; Dussel takes no notice. Mrs. Van Daan has not \nachieved anything, so she has to think of something else. A \npause and then: \"Putti, do put on an apronl Tomorrow I \nshall have to get all the spots out of your suit!” \n\nTm not getting myself dirty!” \n\nAnother moment’s silence. \n\n\"Putti, why don’t you sit down?” \n\nTm comfortable standing up and prefer it!” Pause. \n\n\"Putti, look, du spatst schon!” (\"You are making a mess!”) \n\n\"Yes, Mammy, I’m being careful.” \n\nMrs. Van Daan searches for another subject. \"I say, Putti, \nwhy aren’t there any English air raids now?” \n\n\"Because the weather is bad, Kerli.” \n\n\"But it was lovely yesterday, and they didn’t fly then \neither.” \n\n\"Let’s not talk about it.” \n\n\"Why, surely one can talk about it, or give one’s opinion?” \n\n“No.” \n\n\"Why ever not?” \n\n\"Do be quiet, mammi’chen.” \n\n“Mr. Frank always answers his wife, doesn’t he?” \n\nMr. Van Daan wrestles with himself. This is his tender \nspot, it’s something he can’t take and Mrs. Van Daan begins \nagain: \"The invasion seems as if it will never come!” \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n94 \n\n\nMr. Van Daan goes white; when Mrs. Van Daan sees this, \nshe turns red, but goes on again: \"The British do nothing!” \nThe bomb explodes! \n\n\"And now hold your tongue, donnerwetter-noch-einm&ir \n\nMummy can hardly hold back her laughter. I look straight \nin front of me. \n\nThis sort of thing happens nearly every day, unless they \nhave just had a very bad quarrel, because then they both \nkeep their mouths shut. \n\nI have to go up to the attic to fetch some potatoes. Peter \nis busy there debusing the cat. He looks up, the cat notices \n— pop—he has disappeared through the open window into \nthe gutter. Peter swears. I laugh and disappear. \n\nYours, Anne",

Elli comes to give us our evening freedom. \nImmediately we begin to make some headway with our work. \nFirst, I go upstairs with Elli, where she usually begins by \nhaving a bite from our second course. \n\nBefore Elli is seated, Mrs. Van Daan begins thinking of \nthings she wants. It soon comes out: \"Oh, Elli, I have only \none little wish. , . .* Elli winks at me; whoever comes up- \nstairs, Mrs. Van Daan never misses a single opportunity of \nletting them know what she wants. That must be one of the \nreasons why none of them like coming upstairs. \n\nQuarter to six. Elli departs. I go two floors down to have \na look around. First to the kitchen, then to the private office, \nafter that the coalhole, to open the trap door for Mouschi. \nAfter a long tour of inspection I land up in Kraler’s room. \nVan Daan is looking in all the drawers and portfolios to find \nthe day’s post. Peter is fetching the warehouse key and Boche; \nPim is hauling the typewriters upstairs; Margot is looking \nfor a quiet spot to do her office work; Mrs. Van Daan puts a \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 95 \n\nkettle on the gas ring; Mummy is coming downstairs with a \npan of potatoes; each one knows his own job. \n\nPeter soon returns from the warehouse. The first ques- \ntion is— bread. This is always put in the kitchen cupboard \nby the Ladies; but it is not there. Forgotten? Peter offers to \nlook in the main office. He crouches in front of the door to \nmake himself as small as possible and crawls towards the steel \nlockers on hands and knees, so as not to be seen from out- \nside, gets the bread, which had been put there, and disap- \npears; at least, he wants to disappear, but before he quite \nrealizes what has happened, Mouschi has jumped over him \nand gone and sat right under the writing table. \n\nPeter looks all around— aha, he sees him there, he crawls \ninto the office again and pulls the animal by its tail. Mouschi \nspits, Peter sighs. What has he achieved? Now Mouschi is \nsitting right up by the window cleaning himself, very \npleased to have escaped Peter. Now Peter is holding a piece \nof bread under the cat’s nose as a last decoy. Mouschi will not \nbe tempted and the door closes. I stood and watched it all \nthrough the crack of the door. We work on. Rat, tat, tat. \nThree taps means a meal! \n\nYours, Ante",

As \nthe clock strikes half past eight in the morning, Margot and \nMummy are jittery: “Ssh . . . Daddy, quiet, Otto, ssh . . . \nPirn.” “It is half past eight, come back here, you can’t run \nany more water; walk quietly!” These are the various cries to \nDaddy in the bathroom. As the clock strikes half past eight, \nhe has to be in the living room. Not a drop of water, no \nlavatory, no walking about, everything quiet. As long as \nnone of the office staff are there, everything can be heard in \nthe warehouse. The door is opened upstairs at twenty minutes \npast eight and shortly after there are three taps on the floor: \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\nArne’s porridge. I climb upstairs and fetch my “puppy-dog” \nplate. Down in my room again, everything goes at terrific \nspeed: do my hair, put away my noisy tin pottie, bed in \nplace. Hush, the clock strikes! Upstairs Mrs. Van Daan has \nchanged her shoes and is shuffling about in bedroom slippers. \nMr. Van Daan, too; all is quiet. \n\nNow we have a little bit of real family life. I want to \nread or work, Margot as well, also Daddy and Mummy. \nDaddy is sitting (with Dickens and the dictionary, naturally) \non the edge of the sagging, squeaky bed, where there aren’t \neven any decent mattresses: two bolsters on top of each other \nwill also serve the purpose, then he thinks: \"Mustn’t have \nthem, then I’ll manage without!” \n\nOnce he is reading he doesn’t look up, or about him, laughs \nevery now and then, takes awful trouble to get Mummy \ninterested in a little story. Answer: “I haven’t got time now” \nLooks disappointed for just a second, then reads on again; \na little later, when he comes to something extra amusing, \nhe tries it again: \"You must read this, Mummy!” Mummy \nsits on the “Opklap” 1 bed, reads, sews, knits, or works, what- \never she feels like. She suddenly thinks of something Just \nsays it quickly: “Anne, do you know . . . Margot, just jot \ndown . . . !” After a while peace returns once more. \n\nMargot closes her book with a clap. Daddy raises his eye- \nbrows into a funny curve, his reading wrinkle deepens again, \nand he is lost in his book once more; Mummy begins to \nchatter with Margot, I become curious and listen too 1 Pirn \nis drawn into the discussion . . . nine o’clock! Breakfast! \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nFriday, 10 September, 194S \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nEvery time I write to you something special seems to \nhave happened, but they are more often unpleasant than \n\n^Dutch type of bed, which folds against the wall to look like a bookcase \nwith curtains hanging before it \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n97 \n\n\npleasant things. However, now there is something wonder- \nful going on. Last Wednesday evening, 8 September, we \nsat around listening to the seven o clock news and the first \nthing we heard was: “Here follows the best news of the \nwhole war. Italy has capitulated!” Italy’s unconditional sur- \nrender! The Dutch program from England began at quarter \npast eight. “Listeners, an hour ago, I had just finished writ- \ning the chronicle of the day when the wonderful news of \nItaly’s capitulation came in. I can tell you that I have never \ndeposited my notes in the wastepaper basket with such joy!” \n“God Save the King,” the American national anthem, and \nthe “Internationale” were played. As always, the Dutch \nprogram was uplifting, but not too optimistic. \n\nStill we have troubles, too; it’s about Mr. Koophuis. As \nyou know, we are all very fond of him, he is always cheerful \nand amazingly brave, although he is never well, has a lot of \npain, and is not allowed to eat much or do much walking. \n“When Mr. Koophuis enters, the sun begins to shine,” \nMummy said just recently, and she is quite right. Now he \nhas had to go into the hospital for a very unpleasant ab- \ndominal operation and will have to stay there for at least \nfour weeks. You really ought to have seen how he said good-by \nto us just as usual— he might have simply been going out to \ndo a bit of shopping. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nThursday , 16 September , 194S \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nRelations between us here are getting worse all the time. \nAt mealtimes, no one dares to open their mouths (except \nto allow a mouthful of food to slip in) because whatever \nis said you either annoy someone or it is misunderstood. \nI swallow Valerian pills every day against worry and depres- \nsion, but it doesn’t prevent me from being even more mis- \nerable the next day. A good hearty laugh would help more \nthan ten Valerian pills, but we’ve almost forgotten how to \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\nlaugh. I feel afraid sometimes that from having to be so \nserious m grow a long face and my mouth will droop at \nthe corners. The others don t get any better either, every- \none looks with fear and misgivings towards that great terror, \nwinter. Another thing that does not cheer us up is the fact \nthat the warehouseman, V.M., is becoming suspicious about \nthe “Secret Annexe.” We really wouldn’t mind what V.M. \nthought of the situation if he wasn’t so exceptionally in- \nquisitive, difficult to fob off, and, moreover, not to be trusted. \nOne day Kraler wanted to be extra careful, put on his coat \nat ten minutes to one, and went to the chemist round the \ncorner. He was back in less than five minutes, and sneaked \nlike a thief up the steep stairs that lead straight to us. At a \nquarter past one he wanted to go again, but Elli came to \nwarn him that V.M. was in the office. He did a right-about \nturn and sat with us until half past one. Then he took off \nhis shoes and went in stockinged feet to the front attic \ndoor, went downstairs step by step, and, after balancing \nthere for a quarter of an hour to avoid creaking, he landed \nsafely in the office, having entered from the outside. Elli \nhad been freed of V.M. in the meantime, and came up to us \nto fetch Kraler, but he had already been gone a long time; \nhe was still on the staircase with his shoes off. Whatever \nwould the people in the street have thought if they had \nseen the Manager putting on his shoes outside? Gosh! the \nManager in his socks! \n\nYours, Anne",

From her \nhusband, Dussel, and our protectors she received things \nto eat and flowers. Such are the times we live in! \n\nElli had a fit of nerves this week, she had been sent out \nso often; time and again she had been asked to go and fetch \n\n\n\nthe diary of a YOUNG GIRL 99 \n\nsomething quickly, which meant yet another errand or made \nher feel that she had done something wrong. If you just think \nthat she still has to finish her office work downstairs, that \nKoophuis is ill, Miep at home with a cold, and that she her- \nself has a sprained ankle, love worries, and a grumbling \nfather, then it's no wonder she's at her wit's end. We com- \nforted her and said that if she puts her foot down once or \ntwice and says she has no time, then the shopping lists will \nautomatically get shorter. \n\nThere is something wrong with Mr. Van Daan again, I \ncan see it coming on already! Daddy is very angry for some \nreason or other. Oh, what kind of explosion is hanging over \nus now? If only I wasn't mixed up so much with all these \nrows! If I could only get away! They’ll drive us crazy before \nlong! \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nSunday , 17 October , 194S \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nKoophuis is back again, thank goodness! He still looks \nrather pale, but in spite of this sets out cheerfully to sell \nclothes for Van Daan. It is an unpleasant fact that the \nVan Daans have run right out of money. Mrs. Van Daan \nwon’t part with a thing from her pile of coats, dresses, and \nshoes, Mr. Van Daan’s suit isn’t easily disposed of, because \nhe wants too much for it. The end of the story is not yet in \nsight. Mrs. Van Daan will certainly have to part with her \nfur coat. They’ve had a terrific row upstairs about it, and now \nthe reconciliation period of “oh, darling Putti” and “precious \nKerli” has set in. \n\nI am dazed by all the abusive exchanges that have taken \nplace in this virtuous house during the past month. Daddy \ngoes about with his lips tightly pursed; when anyone speaks \nto him, he looks up startled, as if he is afraid he will have \nto patch up some tricky relationship again. Mummy has red \npatches on her cheeks from excitement. Margot complains \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n100 \n\n\nof headaches. Dussel can’t sleep. Mrs. Van Daan grouses \nthe whole day and I’m going completely crazy! Quite hon- \nestly, I sometimes forget who we are quarreling with and \nwith whom we’ve made it up. \n\nThe only way to take one’s mind off it all is to study, and \nI do a lot of that. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Friday , 29 October , 1948 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nThere have been resounding rows again between Mr. and \nMrs. Van Daan. It came about like this: as I have already \ntold you, the Van Daans are at the end of their money. One \nday, some time ago now, Koophuis spoke about a furrier \nwith whom he was on good terms; this gave Van Daan the \nidea of selling his wife’s fur coat. It’s a fur coat made from \nrabbit skms, and she has worn it seventeen years. He got \n325 florins for it— an enormous sum. However, Mrs. Van \nDaan wanted to keep the money to buy new clothes after the \nwar, and it took some doing before Mr. Van Daan made it \nclear to her that the money was urgently needed for the \nhousehold. \n\nThe yells and screams, stamping and abuse— you can’t pos- \nsibly imagine it! It was frightening. My family stood at the \nbottom of the stairs, holding their breath, ready if necessary \nto drag them apart! All this shouting and weeping and \nnervous tension are so unsettling and such a strain, that in \nthe evening I drop into my bed crying, thanking heaven that \nI sometimes have half an hour to myself. \n\nMr. Koophuis is away again; his stomach gives him no \npeace. He doesn’t even know whether it has stopped bleed- \ning yet. For the first time, he was very down when he told us \nthat he didn’t feel well and was going home. \n\nAll goes well with me on the whole, except that I have \nno appetite. I keep being told: “You don’t look at all well/’ \nI must say that they are doing their very best to keep me \n\n\n\n101 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nup to the mark. Grape sugar, cod-liver oil, yeast tablets, and \ncalcium have all been lined up. \n\nMy nerves often get the better of me: it is especially on \nSundays that I feel rotten. The atmosphere is so oppressive, \nand sleepy and as heavy as lead. You don’t hear a single bird \nsinging outside, and a deadly close silence hangs everywhere, \ncatching hold of me as if it will drag me down deep into an \nunderworld. \n\nAt such times Daddy, Mummy, and Margot leave me \ncold. I wander from one room to another, downstairs and \nup again, feeling like a songbird whose wings have been \nclipped and who is hurling himself in utter darkness against \nthe bars of his cage. “Go outside, laugh, and take a breath \nof fresh air,” a voice cries within me, but I don’t even feel a \nresponse any more; I go and lie on the divan and sleep, to \nmake the time pass more quickly, and the stillness and the \nterrible fear, because there is no way of killing them. \n\nYours, Anne",

Margot nosed through the thick book \nat least three times without finding anything to her liking \nor to suit her purse. Daddy was quicker, and wants a letter \nwritten to the Institute asking for a trial lesson in “Elemen- \ntary Latin.” \n\nTo give me something new to begin as well, Daddy asked \nKoophuis for a children’s Bible so that I could find out \nsomething about the New Testament at last. “Do you want \nto give Anne a Bible for Chanuka?” asked Margot, some- \nwhat perturbed. “Yes— er, I think St. Nicholas Day is a \nbetter occasion,” answered Daddy; “Jesus just doesn’t go with \nChanuka .” 1 \n\nYours, Anne \n\n*See entry for 7 December, 1942. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n102 \n\n\nMonday evening , 8 November, 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nIf you were to read my pile of letters one after another, \nyon would certainly be struck by the many different moods \nin which they are written. It annoys me that I am so depend- \nent on the atmosphere here, but Fm certainly not the only \none— we all find it the same. If I read a book that impresses \nme, I have to take myself firmly in hand, before I mix with \nother people; otherwise they would think my mind rather \nqueer.

        "original_text": "Thursday , 11 November, 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI have a good title for this chapter: \n\nODE TO MY FOUNTAIN FEN \nm MEMORIAM \n\nMy fountain pen has always been one of my most price- \nless possessions; I value it highly, especially for its thick nib, \nfor I can only really write neatly with a thick mb. My foun- \ntain pen has had a very long and interesting pen-life, which \nI will briefly tell you about. \n\nWhen I was nine, my fountain pen arrived in a packet \n(wrapped in cotton wool) as “sample without value” all the \nway from Aachen, where my Grandmother, the kind donor, \nused to live. I was in bed with flu, while February winds \nhowled round the house. The glorious fountain pen had a \nred leather case and was at once shown around to all my \nfriends. I, Anne Frank, the proud owner of a fountain pen! \nWhen I was ten I was allowed to take the pen to school and \nthe mistress went so far as to permit me to write with it. \n\nWhen I was eleven, however, my treasure had to be put \naway again, because the mistress in the sixth form only \nallowed us to use school pens and inkpots. \n\nWhen I was twelve and went to the Jewish Lyceum , 1 my \n\ntype of secondary school specializing in the classics, common in most \ncontinental countries. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n104 \n\n\nfountain pen received a new case in honor of the great occa- \nsion; it could take a pencil as well, and as it closed with a \nzipper looked much more impressive. \n\nAt thirteen the fountain pen came with us to the \"Secret \nAnnexe,” where it has raced through countless diaries and \ncompositions for me. \n\nNow I am fourteen, we have spent our last year together. \n\nIt was on a Friday afternoon after five o'clock. I had \ncome out of my room and wanted to go and sit at the table \nto write, when I was roughly pushed on one side and had \nto make room for Margot and Daddy, who wanted to prac- \ntice their \"Latin.” The fountain pen remained on the table \nunused while, with a sigh, its owner contented herself with \na tiny little comer of the table and started rubbing beans. \n\"Bean rubbing” is making moldy beans decent again. I \nswept the floor at a quarter to six and threw the dirt, to- \ngether with the bad beans, into a newspaper and into the \nstove. A terrific flame leaped out and I thought it was grand \nthat the fire should bum up so well when it was practically \nout All was quiet again, the “Latinites” had finished, and \nI went and sat at the table to clear up my writing things, \nbut look as I might, my fountain pen was nowhere to be \nseen. I looked again, Margot looked, but there was not a trace \nof the thing, \"Perhaps it fell into the stove together with \nthe beans,” Margot suggested. \"Oh, no, of course not!” I \nanswered. When my fountain pen didn't turn up that \nevening, however, we all took it that it had been burned, \nall the more as celluloid is terribly inflammable. \n\nAnd so it was, our unhappy fears were confirmed; when \nDaddy did the stove the following morning the clip used for \nfastening was found among the ashes. Not a trace of the gold \nnib was found. \"Must have melted and stuck to some stone or \nother,” Daddy thought. \n\nI have one consolation, although a slender one: my fountain \npen has been cremated, just what I want later! \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\n105 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nWednesday , 17 November , 194S \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nShattering things are happening. Diphtheria reigns in EUfs \nhome, so she is not allowed to come into contact with us for \nsix weeks. It makes it very awkward over food and shopping, \nnot to mention missing her companionship. Koophuis is still in \nbed and has had nothing but porridge and milk for three \nweeks. Kraler is frantically busy. \n\nThe Latin lessons Margot sends in are corrected by a \nteacher and returned, Margot writing in EHi's name. The \nteacher is very nice, and witty, too. I expect he is glad to have \nsuch a clever pupil. \n\nDussel is very put out, none of us knows why. It began by \nhis keeping his mouth closed upstairs; he didn't utter a word \nto either Mr. or Mrs. Van Daan. Everyone was struck by it, \nand when it lasted a couple of days, Mummy took the oppor- \ntunity of warning him about Mrs. Van Daan, who, if he went \non like this, could make things very disagreeable for him. \n\nDussel said that Mr. Van Daan started the silence, so he \nwas not going to be the one to break it. \n\nNow I must tell you that yesterday was the sixteenth of \nNovember, the day he had been exactly one year in the “Secret \nAnnexe.” Mummy received a plant in honor of the occasion, \nbut Mrs. Van Daan, who for weeks beforehand had made no \nbones about the fact that she thought Dussel should treat us \nto something, received nothing. \n\nInstead of expressing, for die first time, his thanks for our \nunselfishness in taking him in, he didn't say a word. And when \nI asked him, on the morning of the sixteenth, whether I should \ncongratulate or condole, he answered that it didn't matter to \nhim. Mummy, who wanted to act as peacemaker, didn't get \none step further, and finally the situation remained as it was. \n\nDer Man hat einen grossen Geist \nUnd ist so Hein von TatenI 1 \n\nYours, Anne \n\n1 (The spirit of the man is great, \n\n\"How puny are his deeds ! ) \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n106 \n\n\nSaturday , 27 November , 194S \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nYesterday evening, before I fell asleep, who should sudden- \nly appear before my eyes but Lies! \n\nI saw her in front of me, clothed in rags, her face thin and \nworn. Her eyes were very big and she looked so sadly and \nreproachfully at me that I could read in her eyes: “Oh, Anne, \nwhy have you deserted me? Help, oh, help me, rescue me \nfrom this hell!” \n\nAnd I cannot help her, I can only look on, how others suffer \nand die, and can only pray to God to send her back to us. \n\nI just saw Lies, no one else, and now I understand. I mis- \njudged her and was too young to understand her difficulties. \nShe was attached to a new girl friend, and to her it seemed \nas though I wanted to take her away. What the poor girl must \nhave felt like, I know; I know the feeling so well myself! \n\nSometimes, in a flash, I saw something of her life, but a \nmoment later I was selfishly absorbed again in my own pleas- \nures and problems. It was horrid of me to treat her as I did, \nand now she looked at me, oh so helplessly, with her pale face \nand imploring eyes. If only I could help her! \n\nOh, God, that I should have all I could wish for and that \nshe should be seized by such a terrible fate. I am not more \nvirtuous than she; she, too, wanted to do what was right, why \nshould I be chosen to live and she probably to die? What was \nthe difference between us? Why are we so far from each other \nnow? \n\nQuite honestly, I haven't thought about her for months, yes, \nalmost for a year. Not completely forgotten her, but still I had \nnever thought about her like this, until I saw her before me in \nall her misery. \n\nOh, Lies, I hope that, if you live until the end of the war, \nyou will come back to us and that I shall be able to take you \nin and do something to make up for the wrong I did you. \n\nBut when I am able to help her again, then she will not \nneed my help so badly as now. I wonder if she ever thinks of \nme; if so, what would she feel? \n\n\n\n107 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nGood Lord, defend her, so that at least she is not alone. Oh, \nif only You could tell her that I think lovingly of her and with \nsympathy, perhaps that would give her greater endurance. \n\nI must not go on thinking about it, because I don’t get any \nfurther. I only keep seeing her great big eyes, and cannot free \nmyself from them. I wonder if Lies has real faith in herself, \nand not only what has been thrust upon her? \n\nI don’t even know, I never took the trouble to ask her! \n\nLies, Lies, if only I could take you away, if only I could let \nyou share all the things I enjoy. It is too late now, I can’t help, \nor repair the wrong I have done. Rut I shall never forget her \nagain, and I shall always pray for her. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Wednesday , 22 December, 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nA bad attack of flu has prevented me from writing to you \nuntil today. It’s wretched to be ill here. When I wanted to \ncough-one, two, three— I crawled under the blankets and \ntried to stifle the noise. Usually the only result was that the \ntickle wouldn’t go away at all; and milk: and honey, sugar or \nlozenges had to be brought into operation. It makes me dizzy \nto think of all the cures that were tried on me. Sweating, com- \npresses, wet cloths on my chest, dry cloths on my chest, hot \ndrinks, gargling, throat painting, lying still, cushion for extra \nwarmth, hot-water bottles, lemon squashes, and, in addition, \nthe thermometer every two hours! \n\nCan anyone really get better like this? The worst moment \nof all was certainly when Mr. Dussel thought he’d play doctor, \nand came and lay on my naked chest with his greasy head, in \norder to listen to the sounds within. Not only did his hair tickle \nunbearably, but I was embarrassed, in spite of the fact that he \nonce, thirty years ago, studied medicine and has the title of \nDoctor. Why should the fellow come and lie on my heart? \nHe’s not my lover, after all! For that matter, he wouldn’t hear \nwhether it’s healthy or unhealthy inside me anyway; his ears \nneed syringing first, as he’s becoming alarmingly hard of \nhearing. \n\nBut that is enough about illness. I’m as fit as a fiddle again, \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 109 \n\none centimeter taller, two pounds Heavier, pale, and with a \nreal appetite for learning. \n\nThere is not much news to tell you. We are all getting on \nwell together for a change! There's no quarreling—we haven’t \nhad such peace in the home for at least half a year. Elli is \nstill parted from us. \n\nWe received extra oil for Christmas, sweets and syrup; the \n“chief present” is a brooch, made out of a two-and-a-half-cent \npiece, and shining beautifully. Anyway, lovely, but indescrib- \nable. Mr. Dussel gave Mummy and Mrs. Van Daan a lovely \ncake which he had asked Miep to bake for him. With all her \nwork, she has to do that as well! I have also something for \nMiep and Elli. For at least two months I have saved the sugar \nfrom my porridge, you see, and with Mr. Koophuis’s help I’ll \nhave it made into fondants. \n\nIt is drizzly weather, the stove smells, the food lies heavily \non everybody’s tummy, causing thunderous noises on all sides! \nThe war at a standstill, morale rotten. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Friday , 24 December , 1943 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI have previously written about how much we are affected \nby atmospheres here, and I think that in my own case this \ntrouble is getting much worse lately. \n\n“Himmelhoch jauchzend und zum Tode betriiht” 1 certainly \nfits here. I am “Himmelhoch jauchzend” if I only think how \nlucky we are here compared with other Jewish children, and \n“zum Tode betrubf comes over me when, as happened today, \nfor example, Mrs. Koophuis comes and tells us about her \ndaughter Corry’s hockey club, canoe trips, theatrical per- \nformances, and friends. I don’t think I’m jealous of Corry, but \nI couldn’t help feeling a great longing to have lots of fun my- \nself for once, and to laugh until my tummy ached. Especially \n\nX A famous line from Goethe: “On top of the world, or in the depths of \ndespair.” \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n110 \n\n\nat this time of the year with all the holidays for Christmas and \nthe New Year, and we are stuck here like outcasts. Still, I real- \nly ought not to write this, because it seems ungrateful and I’ve \ncertainly been exaggerating. But still, whatever you think of \nme, I can’t keep everything to myself, so I’ll remind you of \nmy opening words— “Paper is patient.” \n\nWhen someone comes in from outside, with the wind in \ntheir clothes and the cold on their faces, then I could bury my \nhead in the blankets to stop myself thinking: “When will we \nbe granted the privilege of smelling fresh air?” And because I \nmust not bury my head in the blankets, but the reverse— I \nmust keep my head high and be brave, the thoughts will \ncome, not once, but oh, countless times. Believe me, if you \nhave been shut up for a year and a half, it can get too much \nfor you some days. In spite of all justice and thankfulness, you \ncan’t crush your feelings. Cycling, dancing, whistling, looking \nout into the world, feeling young, to know that I’m free— \nthat’s what I long for; still, I mustn’t show if, because I some- \ntimes think if all eight of us began to pity ourselves, or went \nabout with discontented faces, where would it lead us? I \nsometimes ask myself, “Would anyone, either Jew or non-Jew, \nunderstand this about me, that I am simply a young girl badly \nin need of some rollicking fun?” I don’t know, and I couldn’t \ntalk about it to anyone, because then I know I should cry. \nCrying can bring such relief. \n\nIn spite of all my theories, and however much trouble I \ntake, each day I miss having a real mother who understands \nme. That is why with everything I do and write I think of the \n“Mumsie” that I want to be for my children later on. The \n“Mumsie” who doesn’t take everything that is said in general \nconversation so seriously, but who does take what 1 say seri- \nously. I have noticed, though I can’t explain how, that the \nword “Mumsie” tells you everything. Do you know what I’ve \nfound? To give me the feeling of calling Mummy something \nwhich sounds like “Mumsie” I often call her “Mum”; then \nfrom that comes “Mums”: the incomplete “Mumsie,” as it \nwere, whom I would so love to honor with the extra “ie” and \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n111 \n\n\nyet who does not realize it It’s a good thing, because it would \nonly make her unhappy. \n\nThat’s enough about that, writing has made my “zum Tode \nhetrubf go off a bit. \n\nYours, Anne",

Last year I didn’t understand the mean- \ning of his words as well as I do now. If he’d only talk about it \nagain, perhaps I would be able to show him that I understand. \n\nI believe that Pirn talked about it because he who “knows \nthe secrets of so many other hearts” had to express his own \nfeelings for once; because otherwise Pirn never says a word \nabout himself, and I don’t think Margot has any idea of all \nPirn has had to go through. Poor Pirn, he can’t make me think \nthat he has forgotten everything. He will never forget this. He \nhas become very tolerant. I hope that I shall grow a bit like \nhim, without having to go through all that. \n\nYours, Anne",

Granny, oh, darling Granny, how little \nwe understood of what she suffered, or how sweet she was. \nAnd besides all this, she knew a terrible secret which she \ncarefully kept to herself the whole time . 1 How faithful and \ngood Granny always was; she would never have let one of us \ndown. Whatever it was, however naughty I had been, Granny \nalways stuck up for me. \n\nGranny, did you love me or didn’t you understand me \neither? I don’t know. No one ever talked about themselves to \nGranny. How lonely Granny must have been, how lonely in \nspite of us! A person can be lonely even if he is loved by many \npeople, because he is still not the “One and Only” to anyone. \n\nAnd Lies, is she still alive? What is she doing? Oh, God, \nprotect her and bring her back to us. Lies, I see in you all the \ntime what my lot might have been, I keep seeing myself in \nyour place. Why then should I often be unhappy over what \nhappens here? Shouldn’t I always be glad, contented, and \nhappy, except when I think about her and her companions in \ndistress? I am selfish and cowardly. Why do I always dream \nand think of the most terrible things-my fear makes me want \nto scream out loud sometimes. Because still, in spite of every- \nthing, I have not enough faith in God. He has given me so \nmuch-which I certainly do not deserve-and I still do so much \nthat is wrong every day. If you think of your fellow creatures, \nthen you only want to cry, you could really cry the whole day \nlong. The only thing to do is to pray that God will perform a \nmiracle and save some of them.

        "original_text": "Sunday, 2 January , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nThis morning when I had nothing to do I turned over some \nof the pages of my diary and several times I came across let- \nters dealing with the subject “Mummy” in such a hotheaded \nway that I was quite shocked, and asked myself: “Anne, is it \nreally you who mentioned hate? Oh, Anne, how could youl” \nI remained sitting with the open page in my hand, and \nthought about it and how it came about that I should have \nbeen so brimful of rage and really so filled with such a thing \nas hate that I had to confide it all in you. I have been trying \nto understand the Anne of a year ago and to excuse her, be- \ncause my conscience isn’t clear as long as I leave you with \nthese accusations, without being able to explain, on looking \nback, how it happened. \n\nI suffer now— and suffered then-from moods which kept my \nhead under water (so to speak) and only allowed me to see \nthe things subjectively without enabling me to consider quiet- \nly the words of the other side, and to answer them as the \nwords of one whom I, with my hotheaded temperament, had \noffended or made unhappy. \n\nI hid myself within myself, I only considered myself and \nquietly wrote down all my joys, sorrows, and contempt in my \ndiary. This diary is of great value to me, because it has be- \ncome a book of memoirs in many places, but on a good many \npages I could certainly put “past and done with ” \n\nI used to be furious with Mummy, and still am sometimes. \nIt’s true that she doesn’t understand me, but I don’t under- \nstand her either. She did love me very much and she was \ntender, but as she landed in so many unpleasant situations \nthrough me, and was nervous and irritable because of other \nworries and difficulties, it is certainly understandable that she \nsnapped at me. \n\nI took it much too seriously, was offended, and was rude \nand aggravating to Mummy, which, in turn, made her un- \nhappy. So it was really a matter of unpleasantness and misery \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n114 \n\n\nrebounding all the time. It wasn't nice for either of us, but it is \npassing. \n\nI just didn't want to see all this, and pitied myself very \nmuch; but that, too, is understandable. Those violent out- \nbursts on paper were only giving vent to anger which in a \nnormal life could have been worked off by stamping my feet \na couple of times in a locked room, or calling Mummy names \nbehind her back. \n\nThe period when I caused Mummy to shed tears is over. I \nhave grown wiser and Mummy's nerves are not so much on \nedge. I usually keep my mouth shut if I get annoyed, and so \ndoes she, so we appear to get on much better together. I can’t \nreally love Mummy in a dependent childlike way—I just don’t \nhave that feeling. \n\nI soothe my conscience now with the thought that it is bet- \nter for hard words to be on paper than that Mummy should \ncarry them in her heart. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Wednesday , 5 January , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI have two things to confess to you today, which will take a \nlong time. But I must tell someone and you are the best one \nto tell, as I know that, come what may, you always keep a \nsecret. \n\nThe first is about Mummy. You know that I've grumbled a \nlot about Mummy, yet still tried to be nice to her again. Now \nit is suddenly clear to me what she lacks. Mummy herself has \ntold us that she looked upon us more as her friends than her \ndaughters. Now that is all very fine, but still, a friend can't \ntake a mother's place. I need my mother as an example which \nI can follow, I want to be able to respect her. I have the feel- \ning that Margot thinks differently about these things and \nwould never be able to understand what I've just told you. \nAnd Daddy avoids all arguments about Mummy. \n\nI imagine a mother as a woman who, in the first place, \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 115 \n\nshows great tact, especially towards her children when they \nreach our age, and who does not laugh at me if I cry about \nsomething-not pain, but other things-like “Mums” does. \n\nOne thing, which perhaps may seem rather fatuous, I have \nnever forgiven her. It was on a day that I had to go to the \ndentist. Mummy and Margot were going to come with me, \nand agreed that I should take my bicycle. When we had fin- \nished at the dentist, and were outside again, Margot and \nMummy told me that they were going into the town to look \nat something or buy something— I don't remember exactly \nwhat. I wanted to go, too, but was not allowed to, as I had \nmy bicycle with me. Tears of rage sprang into my eyes, and \nMummy and Margot began laughing at me. Then I became \nso furious that I stuck my tongue out at them in the street just \nas an old woman happened to pass by, who looked very \nshocked! I rode home on my bicycle, and I know I cried for a \nlong time. \n\nIt is queer that the wound that Mummy made then still \nbums, when I think of how angry I was that afternoon. \n\nThe second is something that is very difficult to tell you, \nbecause it is about myself. \n\nYesterday I read an article about blushing by Sis Heyster. \nThis article might have been addressed to me personally. Al- \nthough I don't blush very easily, the other things in it certain- \nly all fit me. She writes roughly something like this— that a girl \nin the years of puberty becomes quiet within and begins to \nthink about the wonders that are happening to her body. \n\nI experience that, too, and that is why I get the feeling late- \nly of being embarrassed about Margot, Mummy, and Daddy. \nFunnily enough, Margot, who is much more shy than I am, \nisn't at all embarrassed. \n\nI think what is happening to me is so wonderful, and not \nonly what can be seen on my body, but all that is taking place \ninside. I never discuss myself or any of these things with any- \nbody; that is why I have to talk to myself about them. \n\nEach time I have a period— and that has only been three \ntimes-I have the feeling that in spite of all the pain, un- \npleasantness, and nastiness, I have a sweet secret, and that is \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n116 \n\n\nwhy, although it is nothing but a nuisance to me in a way, I \nalways long for the time that I shall feel that secret within me \nagain. \n\nSis Heyster also writes that girls of this age don't feel quite \ncertain of themselves, and discover that they themselves are \nindividuals with ideas, thoughts, and habits. After I came \nhere, when I was just fourteen, I began to think about myself \nsooner than most girls, and to know that I am a “person.” \nSometimes, when I lie in bed at night, I have a terrible desire \nto feel my breasts and to listen to the quiet rhythmic beat of \nmy heart. \n\nI already had these kinds of feelings subconsciously before \nI came here, because I remember that once when I slept with \na girl friend I had a strong desire to kiss her, and that I did \ndo so. I could not help being terribly inquisitive over her \nbody, for she had always kept it hidden from me. I asked her \nwhether, as a proof of our friendship, we should feel one an- \nother's breasts, but she refused. I go into ecstasies every time \nI see the naked figure of a woman, such as Venus, for example. \nIt strikes me as so wonderful and exquisite that I have diffi- \nculty in stopping the tears rolling down my cheeks. \n\nIf only I had a girl friend! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 6 January , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMy longing to talk to someone became so intense that some- \nhow or other I took it into my head to choose Peter. \n\nSometimes if I’ve been upstairs into Peter s room during the \nday, it always struck me as very snug, but because Peter is so \nretiring and would never turn anyone out who became a \nnuisance, I never dared stay long, because I was afraid he \nmight think me a bore. I tried to think of an excuse to stay in \nhis room and get him talking, without it being too noticeable, \nand my chance came yesterday. Peter has a mania for cross- \nword puzzles at the moment and hardly does anything else. I \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 117 \n\nhelped him with them and we soon sat opposite each other at \nhis little table, he on the chair and me on the divan. \n\nIt gave me a queer feeling each time I looked into his deep \nblue eyes, and he sat there with that mysterious laugh playing \nround his lips. I was able to read his inward thoughts. I could \nsee on his face that look of helplessness and uncertainty as to \nhow to behave, and, at the same time, a trace of his sense of \nmanhood. I noticed his shy maimer and it made me feel very \ngentle; I couldn’t refrain from meeting those dark eyes again \nand again, and with my whole heart I almost beseeched him: \noh, tell me, what is going on inside you, oh, can’t you look \nbeyond this ridiculous chatter? \n\nBut the evening passed and nothing happened, except that \nI told him about blushing-naturally not what I have written, \nbut just so that he would become more sure of himself as he \ngrew older. \n\nWhen I lay in bed and thought over the whole situation, \nI found it far from encouraging, and the idea that I should \nbeg for Peter’s patronage was simply repellent. One can do a \nlot to satisfy one’s longings, which certainly sticks out in my \ncase, for I have made up my mind to go and sit with Peter \nmore often and to get him talking somehow or other. \n\nWhatever you do, don’t think I’m in love with Peter— not a \nbit of it! If die Van Daans had had a daughter instead of a \nson, I should have tried to make friends with her too. \n\nI woke at about five to seven this morning and knew at \nonce, quite positively, what I had dreamed. I sat on a chair \nand opposite me sat Peter . . . Wessel. We were looking to- \ngether at a book of drawings by Mary Bos. The dream was so \nvivid that I can still partly remember the drawings. But that \nwas not all-the dream went on. Suddenly Peter’s eyes met \nmine and I looked into those fine, velvet brown eyes for a long \ntime. Then Peter said very softly, “If I had only known, I \nwould have come to you long before!” I turned around \nbrusquely because the emotion was too much for me. And \nafter that I felt a soft, and oh, such a cool kind cheek against \nmine and it felt so good, so good. . , , \n\nI awoke at this point, while I could still feel his cheek \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n118 \n\n\nagainst mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my \nheart, so deep, that there he read how much I had loved him \nand how much I still love him. Tears sprang into my eyes once \nmore, and I was very sad that I had lost him again, but at the \nsame time glad because it made me feel quite certain that \nPeter was still the chosen one. \n\nIt is strange that I should often see such vivid images in \nmy dreams here. First I saw Grandma 1 so clearly one night \nthat I could even distinguish her thick, soft, wrinkled velvety \nskin. Then Granny appeared as a guardian angel; then fol- \nlowed Lies, who seems to be a symbol to me of the sufferings \nof all my girl friends and all Jews. When I pray for her, I pray \nfor all Jews and all those in need. And now Peter, my darling \nPeter— never before have I had such a clear picture of him in \nmy mind. I don't need a photo of him, I can see him before \nmy eyes, and oh, so welll \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Friday , 7 January, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nWhat a silly ass I am! I am quite forgetting that I have \nnever told you the history of myself and all my boy friends. \n\nWhen I was quite small— I was even still at a kindergarten \n—I became attached to Karel Samson. He had lost his father, \nand he and his mother lived with an aunt. One of Karels \ncousins, Hobby, was a slender, good-looking dark boy, who \naroused more admiration than the little, humorous fellow, \nKarel. But looks did not count with me and I was very fond of \nKarel for years. \n\nWe used to he together a lot for quite a long time, but for \nthe rest, my love was unretumed. \n\nThen Peter crossed my path, and in my childish way I real- \nly fell in love. He liked me very much, too, and we were in- \nseparable for one whole summer. I can still remember us walk- \ning hand in hand through the streets together, he in a white \n\nGrandma Is grandmother on Father’s side. Granny on Mother’s side. \n\n\n\n119 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\ncotton suit and me in a short summer dress. At the end of the \nsummer holidays he went into the first form of the high school \nand I into the sixth form of the lower school. He used to meet \nme from school and, vice versa, I would meet him. Peter was a \nvery good-looking boy, tall, handsome, and shm, with an \nearnest, calm, intelligent face. He had dark hair, and wonder- \nful brown eyes, ruddy cheeks, and a pointed nose. I was mad \nabout his laugh, above all, when he looked so mischievous and \nnaughty! \n\nI went to the country for the holidays; when I returned, \nPeter had in the meantime moved, and a much older boy lived \nin the same house. He apparently drew Peter’s attention to \nthe fact that I was a childish little imp, and Peter gave me up. \nI adored him so that I didn’t want to face the truth. I tried to \nhold on to him until it dawned on me that if I went on run- \nning after him I should soon get the name of being boy-mad. \nThe years passed. Peter went around with girls of his own age \nand didn’t even think of saying “Hello” to me any more; but I \ncouldn’t forget him. \n\nI went to the Jewish Secondary School. Lots of boys in our \nclass were keen on me-I thought it was fun, felt honored, but \nwas otherwise quite untouched. Then later on, Harry was \nmad about me, but, as I’ve already told you, I never fell in \nlove again. \n\nThere is a saying “Time heals all wounds,” and so it was \nwith me. I imagined that I had forgotten Peter and that I \ndidn’t like him a bit any more. The memory of him, however, \nlived so strongly in my subconscious mind that I admitted to \nmyself sometimes I was jealous of the other girls, and that \nwas why I didn’t like him any more. This morning I knew that \nnothing has changed; on the contrary, as I grew older and \nmore mature my love grew with me. I can quite understand \nnow that Peter thought me childish, and yet it still hurt that \nhe had so completely forgotten me. His face was shown so \nclearly to me, and now I know that no one else could remain \nwith me hke he does. \n\nI am completely upset by the dream. When Daddy kissed \nme this morning, I could have cried out: “Oh, if only you were \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n120 \n\n\nPeter!\" I think of him all the time and I keep repeating to my- \nself the whole day, “Oh, Petel, darling, darling Petel . . . !” \n\nWho can help me now? I must live on and pray to God that \nHe will let Peter cross my path when I come out of here, and \nthat when he reads the love m my eyes he will say, “Oh, Anne, \nif I had only known, I would have come to you long before!\" \n\nI saw my face in the mirror and it looks quite different. My \neyes look so clear and deep, my cheeks are pink— which they \nhaven’t been for weeks-my mouth is much softer; I look as if \nI am happy, and yet there is something so sad in my expres- \nsion and my smile slips away from my lips as soon as it has \ncome. I’m not happy, because I might know that Peter’s \nthoughts are not with me, and yet I still feel his wonderful \neyes upon me and his cool soft cheek against mine. \n\nOh, Petel, Petel, how will I ever free myself of your image? \nWouldn’t any other in your place be a miserable substitute? \nI love you, and with such a great love that it can’t grow in \nmy heart any more but has to leap out into the open and sud- \ndenly manifest itself in such a devastating way! \n\nA week ago, even yesterday, if anyone had asked me, \n“Which of your friends do you consider would be the most \nsuitable to marry?\" I would have answered, “I don’t know\"; \nbut now I would cry, “Petel, because I love him with all my \nheart and soul. I give myself completely!” But one thing, he \nmay touch my face, but no more. \n\nOnce, when we spoke about sex, Daddy told me that I \ncouldn’t possibly understand the longing yet; I always knew \nthat I did understand it and now I understand it fully. Noth- \ning is so beloved to me now as he, my Petel. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Wednesday, 12 January, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nElli has been back a fortnight. Miep and Henk were away \nfrom their work for two days— they both had tummy upsets. \n\nI have a craze for dancing and ballet at the moment, and \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n121 \n\n\npractice dance steps every evening diligently. I Lave made a \nsupermodern dance frock from a light blue petticoat edged \nwith lace belonging to Mansa. A ribbon is threaded through \nround the top and ties in a bow in the center, and a pink \ncorded ribbon completes the creation. I tried in vain to con- \nvert my gym shoes into real ballet shoes. My stiff limbs are \nwell on the way to becoming supple again like they used to \nbe. One terrific exercise is to sit on the floor, hold a heel in \neach hand, and then lift both legs up in the air. I have to \nhave a cushion under me, otherwise my poor little behind has \na rough time. \n\nEveryone here is reading the book Cloudless Morn. Mummy \nthought it exceptionally good; there are a lot of youth prob- \nlems in it. I thought to myself rather ironically: “Take a bit \nmore trouble with your own young people first!” \n\nI believe Mummy thinks there could be no better relation- \nship between parents and their children, and that no one \ncould take a greater interest in their children s lives than she. \nBut quite definitely she only looks at Margot, who I don't \nthink ever had such problems and thoughts as I do. Still, I \nwouldn’t dream of pointing out to Mummy that, in the case \nof her daughters, it isn’t at all as she imagines, because she \nwould be utterly amazed and wouldn’t know how to change \nanyway; I want to save her the unhappiness it would cause \nher, especially as I know that for me everything would remain \nthe same anyway. \n\nMummy certainly feels that Margot loves her much more \nthan I do, but she thinks that this just goes in phases! Margot \nhas grown so sweet; she seems quite different from what she \nused to be, isn’t nearly so catty these days and is becoming a \nreal friend. Nor does she any longer regard me as a little kid \nwho counts for nothing. \n\nI have an odd way of sometimes, as it were, being able to \nsee myself through someone else’s eyes. Then I view the affairs \nof a certain “Anne” at my ease, and browse through the pages \nof her life as if she were a stranger. Before we came here, \nwhen I didn’t think about things as much as I do now, I used \nat times to have the feeling that I didn’t belong to Mansa, \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n122 \n\n\nPim, and Margot, and that I would always be a bit of an out- \nsider. Sometimes I used to pretend I was an orphan, until I \nreproached and punished myself, telling myself it was all my \nown fault that I played this self-pitying role, when I was real- \nly so fortunate. Then came the time that I used to force my- \nself to be friendly. Every morning, as soon as someone came \ndownstairs I hoped that it would be Mummy who would say \ngood morning to me; I greeted her warmly, because I really \nlonged for her to look lovingly at me. Then she made some re- \nmark or other that seemed unfriendly, and I would go off to \nschool again feeling thoroughly disheartened. On the way \nhome I would make excuses for her because she had so many \nworries, arrive home very cheerful, chatter nineteen to the \ndozen, until I began repeating myself, and left the room wear- \ning a pensive expression, my satchel under my arm. Some- \ntimes I decided to remain cross, but when I came home from \nschool I always had so much news that my resolutions were \ngone with the wind and Mummy, whatever she might be do- \ning, had to lend an ear to all my adventures. Then the time \ncame once more when I didn’t listen for footsteps on the stair- \ncase any longer, and at night my pillow was wet with tears. \n\nEverything grew much worse at that point; enfin, you know \nall about it. \n\nNow God has sent me a helper— Peter ... I just clasp my \npendant, kiss it, and think to myself, “What do I care about \nthe lot of them! Peter belongs to me and no one knows any- \nthing about it.” This way I can get over all the snubs I re- \nceive. Who would ever think that so much can go on in the \nsoul of a young girl? \n\nYours, Anne",

She got some \nextra sugar from Kraler, which made the Van Daans jealous as \nMrs. Van Daan had not been favored in this way for her birth- \nday. But what’s the use of annoying each other with yet more \nunkind words, tears, and angry outbursts. You can be sure of \none thing, Kitty, that we are even more fed up with them than \never 1 Mummy has expressed the wish— one which cannot come \ntrue just now-not to see the Van Daans for a fortnight. \n\nI keep asking myself, whether one would have trouble in \nthe long run, whoever one shared a house with. Or did we \nstrike it extra unlucky? Are most people so selfish and stingy \nthen? I think it’s all to the good to have learned a bit about \nhuman beings, but now I think I’ve learned enough. The war \ngoes on just the same, whether or not we choose to quarrel, or \nlong for freedom and fresh air, and so we should try to make \nthe best of our stay here.

How is it that I \nalways behave quite differently from what I should in other \npeople’s company? \n\nWhy do we trust one another so little? I know there must be \na reason, but still 1 sometimes think it’s horrible that you find \nyou can never really confide in people, even in those who are \nnearest to you. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n124 \n\n\nIt seems as if I’ve grown up a lot since my dream the other \nnight. I’m much more of an “independent being.” You’ll cer- \ntainly be amazed when I tell you that even my attitude to- \nwards the Van Daans has changed. I suddenly see all the \narguments and the rest of it in a different light, and am not as \nprejudiced as I was. \n\nHow can I have changed so much? Yes, you see it suddenly \nstruck me that if Mummy had been different, a real Mumsie, \nthe relationship might have been quite, quite different. It’s \ntrue that Mrs. Van Daan is by no means a nice person, but still \nI do think that half the quarrels could be avoided if it weren’t \nfor the fact that when the conversation gets tricky Mummy is \na bit difficult too. \n\nMrs. Van Daan has one good side, and that is that you can \ntalk to her. Despite all her selfishness, stinginess, and under- \nhandedness, you can make her give in easily, as long as you \ndon’t irritate her and get on the wrong side of her. This way \ndoesn’t work every time, but if you have patience you can try \nagain and see how far you get. \n\nAll the problems of our “upbringing,” of our being spoiled, \nthe food— it could have been quite different if we’d remain \nperfectly open and friendly, and not always only -on the look- \nout for something to seize on. \n\nI know exactly what you’ll say, Kitty: “But, Anne, do these \nwords really come from your lips? From you, who have had to \nlisten to so many harsh words from the people upstairs, from \nyou, the girl who has suffered so many injustices?” And yet \nthey come from me. \n\nI want to start afresh and try to get to the bottom of it all, \nnot be like the saying “the young always follow a bad exam- \nple.” I want to examine the whole matter carefully myself and \nfind out what is true and what is exaggerated. Then if I my- \nself am disappointed in them, I can adopt the same line as \nMummy and Daddy; if not, I shall try first of all to make them \nalter their ideas and if I don’t succeed I shall stick to my own \nopinions and judgment I shall seize every opportunity to dis- \ncuss openly all our points of argument with Mrs. Van Daan \nand not be afraid of declaring myself neutral, even at the cost \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n125 \n\n\nof being called a “know-all.” It is not that I shall be going \nagainst my own family, but from today there will be no more \nunkind gossip on my part. \n\nUntil now I was immovable! I always thought the Van \nDaans were in the wrong, but we too are partly to blame We \nhave certainly been right over the subject matter; but han- \ndling of others from intelligent people (which we consider \nourselves to be!) one expects more insight. I hope that I have \nacquired a bit of insight and will use it well when the occasion \narises. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Monday , 24 January , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nSomething has happened to me; or rather, I can hardly de- \nscribe it as an event, except that I think it is pretty crazy. \nWhenever anyone used to speak of sexual problems at home \nor at school, it was something either mysterious or revolting. \nWoids which had any bearing on the subject were whispered, \nand often if someone didn’t understand he was laughed at. It \nstruck me as very odd and I thought, “Why are people so \nsecretive and tiresome when they talk about these things?” \nRut as I didn’t think that I could change things, I kept my \nmouth shut as much as possible, or sometimes asked girl \nfriends for information. When I had learned quite a lot and \nhad also spoken about it with my parents, Mummy said one \nday, “Anne, let me give you some good advice; never speak \nabout this subject to boys and don’t reply if they begin about \nit.” I remember exactly what my answer was: I said, “No, of \ncourse not! The very idea!” And there it remained. \n\nWhen we first came here, Daddy often told me about things \nthat I would really have preferred to hear from Mummy, and \nI found out the rest from books and things I picked up from \nconversations. Peter Van Daan was never as tiresome over \nthis as the boys at school— once or twice at first perhaps— but \nhe never tried to get me talking. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n126 \n\n\nMrs. Van Daan told us that she had never talked about \nthese things to Peter, and for all she knew neither had her \nhusband. Apparently she didn’t even know how much he \nknew. \n\nYesterday, when Margot, Peter, and I were peeling pota- \ntoes, somehow the conversation turned to Boche. “We still \ndon’t know what sex Boche is, do we?” I asked. \n\n“Yes, certainly,” Peter answered. “He’s a tom.” \n\nI began to laugh. “A tomcat that’s expecting, that’s mar- \nvelous!” \n\nPeter and Margot laughed too over this silly mistake. You \nsee, two months ago, Peter had stated that Boche would soon \nbe having a family, her tummy was growing visibly. However, \nthe fatness appeared to come from the many stolen bones, \nbecause the children didn’t seem to grow fast, let alone make \ntheir appearance! \n\nPeter just had to defend himself. “No,” he said, “you can \ngo with me yourself to look at him. Once when I was playing \naround with him, I noticed quite clearly that he’s a tom.” \n\nI couldn’t control my curiosity, and went with him to the \nwarehouse. Boche, however, was not receiving visitors, and \nwas nowhere to be seen. We waited for a while, began to get \ncold, and went upstairs again. Later in the afternoon I heard \nPeter go downstairs for the second time. I mustered up all my \ncourage to walk through the silent house alone, and reached \nthe warehouse. Boche stood on the packing table playing with \nPeter, who had just put him on the scales to weigh him. \n\n“Hello, do you want to see him?” He didn’t make any \nlengthy preparations, but picked up the animal, turned him \nover on to his back, deftly held his head and paws together, \nand the lesson began. “These are the male organs, these are \njust a few stray hairs, and that is his bottom.” The cat did \nanother half turn and was standing on his white socks once \nmore. \n\nIf any other boy had shown me “the male organs,” I would \nnever have looked at him again. But Peter went on talking \nquite normally on what is otherwise such a painful subject, \nwithout meaning anything unpleasant, and finally put me \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n127 \n\n\nsufficiently at my ease for me to be normal too. We played \nwith Boche, amused ourselves, chattered together, and then \nsauntered through the large warehouse towaids the door. \n\n“Usually, when I want to know something, I find it in some \nbook or other, don t you?” I asked. \n\n“Why on earth? I just ask upstairs. My father knows more \nthan me and has had more experience in such things.” \n\nWe were already on the stair, so I kept my mouth shut after \nthat. \n\n“Things may alter,” as Brer Rabbit said Yes. Really I \nshouldn’t have discussed these things in such a normal way \nwith a girl. I know too definitely that Mummy didn’t mean it \nthat way when she warned me not to discuss the subject with \nboys. I wasn’t quite my usual self for the rest of the day \nthough, in spite of everything. When I thought over our talk, \nit still seemed rather odd. But at least I’m wiser about one \nthing, that there really are young people-and of the opposite \nsex too-who can discuss these things naturally without mak- \ning fun of them. \n\nI wonder if Peter really does ask his parents much. Would \nhe honestly behave with them as he did with me yesterday? \nAh, what would I know about it! \n\nYours, Anne",

Although I am extraordinarily industrious over my \nlessons, and can already follow the English Home Service \nquite well on the wireless, I still devote many Sundays to sort- \ning and looking over my large collection of film stars, which is \nquite a respectable size by now. \n\nI am awfully pleased whenever Mr. Kraler brings the \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n128 \n\n\nCinema and Theater with him on Mondays. Although this \nlittle gift is often called a waste of money by the less worldly \nmembers of the household, they are amazed each time at how \naccurately I can state who is in a certain film, even after a \nyear. Elk, who, on her days off, often goes to the movies with \nher boy friend, tells me the titles of the new films each week; \nand in one breath I rattle off the names of the stars who ap- \npear m them, together with what the reviews say. Not so long \nago, Mum said that I wouldn't need to go to a cinema later on \nbecause I knew the plots, the names of the stars, and the \nopinions of the reviews all by heart. \n\nIf ever I come sailing in with a new hair style, they all look \ndisapprovingly at me, and I can be quite sure that someone \nwill ask which glamorous star I’m supposed to be imitating. \nThey only half beheve me if I reply that it's my own invention. \n\nBut to continue about the hair style — it doesn't stay put for \nmore than half an hour; then I’m so tired of the remarks peo- \nple pass that I quickly hasten to the bathroom and restore my \nordinary house-garden-kitchen hair style. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Friday , 28 January, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI asked myself this morning whether you don’t sometimes \nfeel rather like a cow who has had to chew over all the old \npieces of news again and agam, and who finally yawns loudly \nand silently wishes that Anne would occasionally dig up some- \nthing new. \n\nAlas, I know it’s dull for you, but try to put yourself in my \nplace, and imagine how sick I am of the old cows who keep \nhaving to be pulled out of the ditch again. If the conversation \nat mealtimes isn’t over politics or a delicious meal, then Mum- \nmy or Mrs. Van Daan trot out one of the old stories of their \nyouth, which we’ve heard so many times before; or Dussel \ntwaddles on about his wife’s extensive wardrobe, beautiful \nrace horses, leaking rowboats, boys who can swim at the age \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n129 \n\n\nof four, muscular pams and nervous patients. What it all boils \ndown to is this- that if one of the eight of us opens his mouth, \nthe other seven can finish the story for him! We all know the \npoint of every joke from the start, and the storyteller is alone \nin laughing at his witticisms The various milkmen, grocers, \nand butchers of the two ex-housewives have already grown \nbeards in our minds, so often have they been praised to the \nskies or pulled to pieces; it is impossible for anything in the \nconversation here to be fresh or new \n\nStill, all this would be bearable if the grownups didn’t have \ntheir little way of telling the stories, with which Koophuis, \nHenk, or Miep oblige the company, ten times over and adding \ntheir own little frills and furbelows, so that I often have to \npinch my arm under the table to prevent myself from putting \nthem right. Little children such as Anne must never, under \nany circumstances, know better than the grownups, however \nmany blunders they make, and to whatever extent they allow \ntheir imaginations to run away with them. \n\nOne favorite subject of Koophuis’s and Henk’s is that of \npeople in hiding and in the underground movement. They \nknow very well that anything to do with other people in hid- \ning interests us tremendously, and how deeply we can sym- \npathize with the sufferings of people who get taken away, and \nrejoice with the liberated prisoner. \n\nWe are quite as used to the idea of going into hiding, or \n“underground,” as in bygone days one was used to Daddy’s \nbedioom slippers warming in front of the fire. \n\nThere are a great number of organizations, such as “The \nFree Netherlands,” which forge identity cards, supply money \nto people “undergiound,” find hiding places for people, and \nwork for young men in hiding, and it is amazing how much \nnoble, unselfish work these people are doing, risking their own \nhves to help and save others. Our helpers are a very good ex- \nample They have pulled us thiough up till now and we hope \nthey will bring us safely to dry land. Otherwise, they will have \nto shaie the same fate as the many others who are being \nsearched for. Never have we heard one word of the burden \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n130 \n\n\nwhich we certainly must be to them, never has one of them \ncomplained of all the trouble we give. \n\nThey all come upstairs every day, talk to the men about \nbusiness and politics, to the women about food and wartime \ndifficulties, and about newspapers and books with the chil- \ndren. They put on the brightest possible faces, bring flowers \nand presents for birthdays and bank holidays, are always \nready to help and do all they can. That is something we must \nnever forget; although others may show heroism in the war or \nagainst the Germans, our helpers display heroism in their \ncheerfulness and affection. \n\nThe wildest tales are going around, but still they are usually \nfounded on fact. For instance, Koophuis told us this week \nthat in Gelderland two football elevens met, and one side con- \nsisted solely of members of the “underground” and the other \nwas made up of members of the police. New ration books are \nbeing handed out in Hilversum. In order that the many peo- \nple in hiding may also draw rations, the officials have given in- \nstructions to those of them in the district to come at a certam \ntime, so that they can collect their documents from a separate \nlittle table Still, they’ll have to be careful that such impudent \ntricks do not reach the ears of the Germans. \n\nYours, Anne",

If you were \nhere, on the one hand, you would probably feel the effect of \nall these preparations just as I do and, on the other, you would \nlaugh at us for making such a fuss-who knows— perhaps for \nnothing. \n\nAll the newspapers are full of the invasion and are driving \npeople mad by saying that “In the event of the English land- \ning in Holland, the Germans will do all they can to defend \nthe country, if necessary they will resort to flooding.” With \nthis, maps have been published, on which the parts of Holland \n\n\n\n131 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nthat will be under water are marked. As this applies to large \nparts of Amsterdam, the first question was, what shall we do \nif the water in the streets rises to one meter? The answers \ngiven by diffeient people vary considerably. \n\n“As walking or cycling is out of the question, we shall have \nto wade through the stagnant water.” \n\n“Of course not, one will have to try and swim. We shall all \nput on our bathing suits and caps and swim under water as \nmuch as possible, then no one will see that we are Jews.” \n\n“Oh, what nonsense! I’d like to see the ladies swimming, if \nthe rats started biting their legs!” (That was naturally a man: \njust see who screams the loudest!) \n\n“We shan’t be able to get out of the house anyway; the \nwarehouse will definitely collapse if there is a flood, it is so \nwobbly already.” \n\n“Listen, folks, all joking apart, we shall try and get a boat.” \n\n“Why bother? I know something much better. We each get \nhold of a wooden packing case from the attic and row with a \nsoup ladle!” \n\n“I shall walk on stilts: I used to be an expert at it in my \nyouth ” \n\n“Henk Van Santen won’t need to, he’s sure to take his wife \non his back, then she’ll be on stilts ” \n\nThis gives you a rough idea, doesn’t it, Kit? \n\nThis chatter is all very amusing, but the truth may be other- \nwise. A second question about the invasion was bound to \narise what do we do if the Germans evacuate Amsterdam? \n\n“Leave the city too, and disguise ourselves as best we can.” \n\n“Don’t go, whatever happens, stay put! The only thing to \ndo is to remain here! The Germans are quite capable of driv- \ning the whole population right into Germany, where they will \nall die.” \n\n“Yes, naturally, we shall stay here, since this is the safest \nplace Well try and fetch Koophuis and his family over here \nto come and live with us Well try and get hold of a sack of \nwood wool, then we can sleep on the floor. Let’s ask Miep \nand Koophuis to start bringing blankets here.” \n\n“Well order some extra corn in addition to our sixty \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n132 \n\n\npounds. Let’s get Henk to try and obtain more peas and \nbeans, we have about sixty pounds of beans and ten pounds \nof peas m the house at present. Don’t forget that we’ve got \nfifty tins of vegetables.” \n\n“Mummy, just count up how much we’ve got of other food, \nwill you?” \n\n“Ten tins of fish, forty tins of milk, ten kilos of milk powder, \nthree bottles of salad oil, four preservmg jars of butter, four \nditto of meat, two wicker-covered bottles of strawberries, two \nbottles of raspberries, twenty bottles of tomatoes, ten pounds \nof rolled oats, eight pounds of rice; and that’s all. \n\n“Our stock’s not too bad, but if you think that we may be \nhaving visitors as well and drawing from reserves each week, \nthen it seems more than it actually is. We have sufficient coal \nand firewood in the house, also candles. Let’s all make little \nmoneybags, which could easily be hidden in our clothing, in \ncase we want to take money with us. \n\n“We’ll make lists of the most important things to take, \nshould we have to run for it, and pack rucksacks now m readi- \nness. If it gets that far, well put two people on watch, one in \nthe front and one in the back loft. I say, what’s the use of col- \nlecting such stocks of food, if we haven’t any water, gas, or \nelectricity?” \n\n“Then we must cook on the stove. Filter and boil our water. \nWe’ll clean out some large wicker bottles and store water m \nthem.” \n\nI hear nothing but this sort of talk the whole day long, in- \nvasion and nothing but invasion, arguments about suffering \nfrom hunger, dying, bombs, fire extinguishers, sleepmg bags, \nJewish vouchers, poisonous gases, etc., etc. None of it is ex- \nactly cheering. The gentlemen m the “Secret Annexe” give \npretty straightforward warnings; an example is the following \nconversation with Henk: \n\n“Secret Annexe”: “We are afraid that if the Germans with- \ndraw, they will take the whole population with them.” \n\nHenk: ‘“That is impossible, they haven’t the trains at their \ndisposal.” \n\n“S A.”.* “Trains? Do you really think they’d put civilians in \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n133 \n\n\ncarriages? Out of the question. They could use ‘shank's \nmare.' \" (Per pedes apostolorum, Dussel always says. ) \n\nH.: “I don't believe a word of it, you look on the black \nside of everything What would be their object in driving all \nthe civilians along with them?\" \n\n“S A.\": “Didn’t you know that Goebbels said, If we have \nto withdraw, we shall slam the doors of all the occupied \ncountries behmd us'?\" \n\nH.. “They have said so much already.” \n\n“S.A.\": “Do you think the Germans are above doing such \na thing or too humane? What they think is this. If we have \ngot to go down, then everybody m our clutches will go down \nwith us.”’ \n\nH.: “Tell that to the Marines; I just don’t believe it!\" \n\n“S.A.”: “It’s always the same song; no one will see danger \napproaching until it is actually on top of him.\" \n\nH : “But you know nothing definite; you just simply sup- \npose ” \n\n“$ A “We have all been through it ourselves, first in \nGermany, and then here. And what is going on in Russia?” \n\nH . “You mustn’t mclude the Jews. I don’t think anyone \nknows what is going on in Russia The English and the Rus- \nsians are sure to exaggerate things for propaganda purposes, \njust like the Germans \" \n\n“S.A.\": “Out of the question, the English have always told \nthe truth over the wireless. And suppose they do exaggerate \nthe news, the facts are bad enough anyway, because you can’t \ndeny that many millions of peace-loving people were just \nsimply muidered or gassed in Poland and Russia\" \n\nI will spare you further examples of these conversations; I \nmyself keep very quiet and don't take any notice of all the \nfuss and excitement. I have now reached the stage that I \ndon’t care much whether I live or die. The world will still \nkeep on turning without me; what is going to happen, \nwill happen, and anyway it’s no good trying to resist. \n\nI trust to luck and do nothing but work, hoping that all \nwill end well. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n134",

This annoyed Peter, and the others too. After re- \nstraining himself for half an hour, Peter asked somewhat irri- \ntably if the twisting and turning might stop. Dussel answered \nin his most hoity-toity manner, Tm getting it all right.” Peter \nbecame angry, was rude, Mr. Van Daan took his side, and \nDussel had to give in. That was all. \n\nThe reason in itself was very unimportant, but Peter seems \nto have taken it very much to heart. In any case, when I was \nrummaging about in the bookcase in the attic, he came up to \nme and began telhng me the whole story. I didn’t know any- \nthing about it, but Peter soon saw that he had found an atten- \ntive ear and got fairly into his stride. \n\n“Yes, and you see,” he said, “I don’t easily say anything, \nbecause I know beforehand that I’ll only become tongue-tied. \nI begin to stutter, blush, and twist around what I want to say, \nuntil I have to break off because I simply can’t find the words. \nThat’s what happened yesterday, I wanted to say something \nquite different, but once I had started, I got m a hopeless \nmuddle and that’s frightful. I used to have a bad habit; I wish \nI still had it now. If I was angry with anyone, rather than \nargue it out I would get to work on him with my fists. I quite \nrealize that this method doesn’t get me anywhere; and that is \nwhy I admire you. You are never at a loss for a word, you say \nexactly what you want to say to people and are never the least \nbit shy.” \n\n“I can tell you, you’re making a big mistake,” I answered. \n“I usually say things quite differently from the way I meant to \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n136 \n\n\nsay them, and then I talk too much and far too long, and that’s \njust as bad.” \n\nI couldn’t help laughing to myself over this last sentence. \nHowever, I wanted to let him go on talking about himself, so \nI kept my amusement to myself, went and sat on a cushion on \nthe floor, put my arms around my bent knees, and looked at \nhim attentively. \n\nI am very glad that there is someone else in the house who \ncan get into the same fits of rage as I get into I could see it \ndid Peter good to pull Dussel to pieces to his heart’s content, \nwithout fear of my telling tales. And as for me, I was very \npleased, because I sensed a real feeling of fellowship, such as \nI can only remember having had with my girl friends. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Wednesday, 16 February, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nIt’s Margot’s birthdav. Peter came at half past twelve to \nlook at the presents and stayed talking much longer than was \nstrictly necessary— a thing he’d have never done otherwise In \nthe afternoon I went to get some coffee and, after that, pota- \ntoes, because I wanted to spoil Mai got for ]ust that one day m \nthe year I went through Peter’s room; he took all his papers \noff the stairs at once and I asked whether I should close the \ntrap door to the attic. “Yes,” he replied, “knock when you \ncome back, then I’ll open it for you ” \n\nI thanked him, went upstairs, and searched at least ten min- \nutes in the large barrel for the smallest potatoes Then my \nback began to ache and I got cold Naturally I didn’t knock, \nbut opened the trap door myself, but still he came to meet me \nmost obligingly, and took the pan from me. \n\n“I’ve looked for a long time, these are the smallest I could \nfind,” I said. \n\n“Did you look in the big barrel?” \n\n“Yes, I’ve been over them all.” \n\nBy this time I was standing at the bottom of the stairs and \n\n\n\n137 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nhe looked searchingly in the pan which he was still holding. \n“Oh, but these are first-rate,” he said, and added when I took \nthe pan from him, “I congratulate you!” At the same time he \ngave me such a gentle warm look which made a tender glow \nwithin me. I could really see that he wanted to please me, and \nbecause he couldn’t make a long complimentary speech he \nspoke with his eyes. I understood him, oh, so well, and was \nvery grateful. It gives me pleasure even now when I recall \nthose words and that look he gave me. \n\nWhen I went downstairs, Mummy said that I must get some \nmore potatoes, this time for supper. I willingly offered to go \nupstairs again. \n\nWhen I came into Peter’s room, I apologized at having to \ndisturb him again. When I was already on the stairs he got \nup, and went and stood between the door and the wall, firmly \ntook hold of my arm, and wanted to hold me back by force. \n\nTil go,” he said. I rephed that it really wasn’t necessary \nand that I didn’t have to get particularly small ones this time. \nThen he was convinced and let my arm go. On the way down, \nhe came and opened the trap door and took the pan again. \nWhen I reached the door, I asked, “What are you doing?” \n“French,” he replied. I asked if I might glance through the \nexercises, washed my hands, and went and sat on the divan \nopposite him. \n\nWe soon began talking, after I’d explained some of the \nFrench to him. He told me that he wanted to go to the Dutch \nEast Indies and live on a plantation later on. He talked about \nhis home life, about the black market, and then he said that \nhe felt so useless. I told him that he certainly had a very strong \ninferiority complex. He talked about the Jews. He would have \nfound it much easier if he’d been a Christian and if he could \nbe one after the war. I asked if he wanted to be baptized, but \nthat wasn’t the case either. Who was to know whether he was \na Jew when the war was over? he said. \n\nThis gave me rather a pang; it seems such a pity that there’s \nalways just a tinge of dishonesty about him. For the rest we \nchatted very pleasantly about Daddy, and about judging peo» \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n138 \n\n\npies characters and all kinds of things, I can’t remember \nexactly what now. \n\nIt was half past four by the time I left. * \n\nIn the evening he said something else that I thought was \nnice. We were talking about a picture of a film star that I’d \ngiven him once, which has now been hanging in his room for \nat least a year and a half He liked it very much and I offered \nto give him a few more sometime “No,” he replied, “I’d lather \nleave it like this. I look at these every day and they have \ngrown to be my fnends.” \n\nNow I understand more why he always hugs Mouschi. He \nneeds some affection, too, of course. \n\nI’d forgotten something else that he talked about. He said, \n“I don’t know what fear is, except when I think of my own \nshortcomings. But I’m getting over that too ” \n\nPeter has a terrible inferiority complex. For instance, he \nalways thinks that he is so stupid, and we are so clever. If I \nhelp him with his French, he thanks me a thousand times. \nOne day I shall turn around and say “Oh, shut up, you’re \nmuch better at English and geography!” \n\nYours, Anne",

I helped a bit upstairs, but I didn’t \nhave more than a few fleeting words with “him.” At half past \ntwo, when everyone had gone to their own rooms, either to \nsleep or to read, I went to the private office, with my blanket \nand everything, to sit at the desk and read or write. It was \nnot long before it all became too much for me, my head \ndrooped on to my arm, and I sobbed my heart out. The tears \nstreamed down my cheeks and I felt desperately unhappy. \nOh, if only “he” had come to comfort me. It was four o’clock \nby the time I went upstairs again. I went for some potatoes, \nwith fresh hope in my heart of a meeting, but while I was still \nsmartening up my hair in the bathroom he went down to see \nBoche in the warehouse. \n\nSuddenly I felt the tears coming back and I hurried to the \nlavatory, quickly grabbing a pocket mirror as I passed. There \nI sat then, fully dressed, while the tears made dark spots on \nthe red of my apron, and I felt very wretched. \n\nThis is what was going through my mind. Oh, I’ll never \nreach Peter like this. Who knows, perhaps he doesn’t like me \nat all and doesn’t need anyone to confide in. Perhaps he only \nthinks about me in a casual sort of way. I shall have to go on \nalone once more, without friendship and without Peter. Per- \nhaps soon I’ll be without hope, without comfort, or anything \nto look forward to again. Oh, if I could nestle my head against \nhis shoulder and not feel so hopelessly alone and desertedl \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n140 \n\n\nWho knows, perhaps he doesn’t care about me at all and \nlooks at the others m just the same way Perhaps I only \nimagined that it was especially for me? Oh, Peter, if only you \ncould see or hear me. If the truth were to prove as bad as that, \nit would be more than I could bear. \n\nHowever, a little later fresh hope and anticipation seemed \nto return, even though the tears were still streaming down \nmy cheeks. \n\nYours, Anne",

Nearly every morning I go to the attic where Peter \nworks to blow the stuffy air out of my lungs From my fa- \nvorite spot on the floor I look up at the blue sky and the bare \nchestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops shine, ap- \npearing like silver, and at the seagulls and the other birds as \nthey glide on the wind . \n\nHe stood with his head against a thick beam, and I sat \ndown. We breathed the fresh air, looked outside, and both \nfelt that the spell should not be broken by words. We re- \nmained like this for a long time, and when he had to go up to \nthe loft to chop wood, I knew that he was a nice fellow. He \nclimbed the ladder, and I followed, then he chopped wood \nfor about a quarter of an hour, during which time we still \nremained silent. I watched him from where I stood, he was \nobviously doing his best to show off his strength. But I looked \nout of the open window too, over a large area of Amsterdam, \nover all the roofs and on to the horizon, which was such a \npale blue that it was hard to see the dividmg line. “As long as \nthis exists,” I thought, “and I may live to see it, this sunshine, \nthe cloudless skies, while this lasts, I cannot be unhappy.” \n\nThe best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely, or un- \nhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quite \nalone with the heavens, nature, and God. Because only then \n\n\n\n141 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\ndoes one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes \nto see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As \nlong as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that \nthen there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever \nthe circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature \nbrings solace in all troubles. \n\nOh, who knows, perhaps it wont be long before I can share \nthis overwhelming feeling of bliss with someone who feels \nthe way I do about it. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nA thought: \n\nWe miss so much here, so very much and for so long now: \nI miss it too, just as you do. I’m not talking of outward things, \nfor we are looked after m that way, no, I mean the inward \nthings. Like you, I long for freedom and fresh air, but I be- \nlieve now that we have ample compensation for our priva- \ntions. I realized this quite suddenly when I sat in front of the \nwindow this morning. I mean inward compensation. \n\nWhen I looked outside right into the depth of Nature and \nGod, then I was happy, really happy. And Peter, so long as I \nhave that happiness here, the joy m nature, health and a lot \nmore besides, all the while one has that, one can always re- \ncapture happiness. \n\nRiches can all be lost, but that happiness in your own heart \ncan only be veiled, and it will still bring you happiness again, \nas long as you live. As long as you can look fearlessly up into \nthe heavens, as long as you know that you are pure within \nand that you will still find happiness.",

His is too superficial, loves flirting \nand doesn’t trouble much about what he thinks. Mine does \nbother about me, but lacks sensitiveness, real motherliness. \n\nPeter and I both wrestle with our inner feelings, we are still \nuncertain and are really too sensitive to be roughly treated. \nIf we are, then my reaction is to “get away from it all.” But as \nthat is impossible, I hide my feelings, throw my weight about \nthe place, am noisy and boisterous, so that everyone wishes \nthat I was out of the way. \n\nHe, on the contrary, shuts himself up, hardly talks at all, \nis quiet, day-dreams and in his way carefully conceals his true \nself. \n\nBut how and when will we finally reach each other? I don’t \nknow quite how long my common sense will keep this long- \ning under control. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Wednesday , 1 March , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMy own affairs have been pushed into the background by \n-a burglary. I’m becoming boring with all my burglars, but \nwhat can I do, they seem to take such a delight in honoring \nKolen & Co. with their visits. This burglary is much more \ncomplicated than the one in July 1943. \n\nWhen Mr. Van Daan went to Kraler s office at half past \nseven, as usual, he saw that the communicating glass doors \nand the office door were open. Surprised at this, he walked \nthrough and was even more amazed to see that the doors of \nthe little dark room were open too, and that there was a ter- \nrible mess in the main office. “There has been a burglar,” he \nthought to himself at once, and to satisfy himself he went \nstraight downstairs to look at the front door, felt the Yale \nlock, and found everything closed. “Oh, then both Peter and \nElli must have been very slack this evening,” he decided. He \nremained in Kraler’s room for a while, then switched off the \nlamp, and went upstairs, without worrying much about either \nthe open doors or the untidy office. \n\nThis morning Peter knocked at our door early and came \nwith the not so pleasant news that the front door was wide \nopen. He also told us that the projector and Kraler’s new \nportfolio had both disappeared from the cupboard. Peter was \ntold to close the door. Van Daan told us of his discoveries \nthe previous evening and we were all awfully worried. \n\nWhat must have happened is that the thief had a skeleton \nkey, because the lock was quite undamaged. He must have \ncrept into the house quite early and closed the door behind \nhim, hidden himself when disturbed by Mr. Van Daan, and \n\n\nl The bells in old dock towers play tunes. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n144 \n\n\nwhen he departed fled with his spoils, leaving the door open \nin his haste. Who can have our key? Why didn’t the thief go \nto the warehouse? Might it be one of our own warehouse- \nmen, and would he perhaps betray us, since he certainly \nheard Van Daan and perhaps even saw him? \n\nIt is all very creepy, because we don’t know whether this \nsame burglar may not take it into his head to visit us again. \nOr perhaps it gave him a shock to find that there was some- \none walking about in the house? \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nThursday , 2 \n\n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMargot and I were both up in the attic today; although we \nwere not able to enjoy it together as I had imagined, still I do \nknow that she shares my feelings over most things. \n\nDuring dish washing Elli began telling Mummy and Mrs. \nVan Daan that she felt very discouraged at times. And what \nhelp do you think they gave her? Do you know what \nMummy’s advice was? She should try to think of all the \nother people who are in trouble! What is the good of think- \ning of misery when one is already miserable oneself? I said \nthis too and was told, “You keep out of this sort of con- \nversation ” \n\nAren’t the grownups idiotic and stupid? Just as if Peter, \nMargot, Elli, and I don’t all feel the same about things, and \nonly a mother’s love or that of a very, very good friend can \nhelp us. These mothers here just don’t understand us at all. \nPerhaps Mrs. Van Daan does a little more than Mummy. Oh, \nI would have so liked to say something to poor Elli, some- \nthing that I know from experience would have helped her. \nBut Daddy came between us and pushed me aside. \n\nAren’t they all stupid! We aren’t allowed to have any \nopinions. People can tell you to keep your mouth shut, but \nit doesn’t stop you having your own opinion. Even if people \nare still very young, they shouldn’t be prevented from saying \nwhat they think. \n\n\n\n145 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nOnly great love and devotion can help Elli, Margot, Peter, \nand me, and none of us gets it. And no one, especially the \nstupid “know-alls” here, can understand us, because we are \nmuch more sensitive and much more advanced in our \nthoughts than anyone here would ever imagine m their wild- \nest dreams. \n\nMummy is grumbling again at the moment-she is obvi- \nously jealous because I talk more to Mrs. Van Daan than to \nher nowadays. \n\nI managed to get hold of Peter this afternoon and we talked \nfor at least three quarters of an hour. Peter had the greatest \ndifficulty in saying anything about himself, it took a long \ntime to draw him out. He told me how often his parents \nquarrel over politics, cigarettes, and all kinds of things. He \nwas very shy. \n\nThen I talked to him about my parents. He defended \nDaddy: he thought him a “first-rate chap.” Then we talked \nabout “upstairs” and “downstairs” again; he was really rather \namazed that we don’t always like his parents. “Peter,” I said, \n“you know Im always honest, so why shouldn’t I tell you \nthat we can see their faults too.” And among other things I \nalso said, “I would so like to help you, Peter; can’t I? You \nare in such an awkward position and, although you don’t \nsay anything, it doesn’t mean that you don’t care.” \n\n“Oh, I would always welcome your help.” \n\n“Perhaps you would do better to go to Daddy, he wouldn’t \nlet anything go any further, take it from me; you can easily \ntell him!” \n\n“Yes, he is a real pal.” \n\n“You’re very fond of him, aren’t you?” Peter nodded and \nI went on: “And he is of you tool” \n\nHe looked up quickly and blushed, it was really moving \nto see how these few words pleased him. \n\n“Do you think so?” he asked. \n\n“Yes,” I said, “you can easily tell by little things that slip \nout now and then!” \n\nPeter is a first-rate chap, too, just like Daddy! \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n146",

I finally \nmanaged to ask him today whether he didn’t find my chatter \na nuisance; he only said: “It’s okay, I like it!” \n\nTo what extent this answer was just shyness, I am not able \nto judge. \n\nKitty, I’m just like someone in love, who can only talk \nabout her darling. And Peter really is a darling. When shall \nI be able to tell him so? Naturally, only if he thinks I’m a \ndarling too. But I’m quite capable of looking after myself, \nand he knows that very well.

Peter flushed and \nlooked very embarrassed, and I was about to explode. \n\nWhy can't these people keep their mouths shut? \n\nYou can't imagine how horrible it is to stand by and see \nhow lonely he is and yet not be able to do anything. I can \nso well imagine, just as if I were in his place, how desperate \nhe must feel sometimes in quarrels and in love. Poor Peter, \nhe needs love very much! \n\nWhen he said he didn't need any friends how harsh the \nwords sounded to my ears. Oh, how mistaken he is! I don’t \nbebeve he meant it a bit. \n\nHe clings to his solitude, to his affected indifference and his \ngrown-up ways, but it’s just an act, so as never, never to show \nhis real feelings. Poor Peter, how long will he be able to go \non playing this role? Surely a terrible outburst must follow as \nthe result of this superhuman effort? \n\nOh, Peter, if only I could help you, if only you would let \nme 1 Together we could drive away your loneliness and mine! \n\nI think a lot, but I don’t say much. I am happy if I see \nhim and if the sun shines when I’m with him. I was very \nexcited yesterday; while I was washing my hair, I knew that \nhe was sitting in the room next to ours. I couldn’t do any- \nthing about it; the more quiet and senous I feel inside, the \nmore noisy I become outwardly. \n\nWho will be the first to discover and break through this \narmor? I’m glad after all that the Van Daans have a son \nand not a daughter, my conquest could never have been so \ndifficult, so beautiful, so good, if I had not happened to hit \non someone of the opposite sex. \n\nYours, Anne \n\nP.S. You know that I’m always honest with you, so I must \ntell you that I actually live from one meeting to the next \n\n\n\n149 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nI keep hoping to discover that he too is waiting for me all \nthe time and Im thrilled if I notice a small shy advance \nfrom his side. I believe he’d like to say a lot just like I would; \nlittle does he know that it’s just his clumsiness that attracts \nme. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Tuesday , 7 March, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nIf I think now of my life in 1942, it all seems so unreal. \nIt was quite a different Anne who enjoyed that heavenly \nexistence from the Anne who has grown wise within these \nwalls. Yes, it was a heavenly life. Boy friends at every turn, \nabout twenty friends and acquaintances of my own age, the \ndarling of nearly all the teachers, spoiled from top to toe by \nMummy and Daddy, lots of sweets, enough pocket money, \nwhat more could one want? \n\nYou will certainly wonder by what means I got around all \nthese people. Peter s word 4 attractiveness” is not altogether \ntrue. All Hie teachers were entertained by my cute answers, \nmy amusing remarks, my smiling face, and my questioning \nlooks. That is all I was— a terrible flirt, coquettish and amus- \ning. I had one or two advantages, which kept me rather in \nfavor. I was industrious, honest, and frank. I would never \nhave dreamed of cribbing from anyone else. I shared my \nsweets generously, and I wasn’t conceited. \n\nWouldn’t I have become rather forward with so much \nadmiration? It was a good thing that in the midst of, at the \nheight of, all this gaiety, I suddenly had to face reality, and \nit took me at least a year to get used to the fact that there \nwas no more admiration forthcoming. \n\nHow did I appear at school? The one who thought of new \njokes and pranks, always “king of the castle,” never in a bad \nmood, never a crybaby. No wonder everyone liked to cycle \nwith me, and I got their attentions. \n\nNow I look back at that Anne as an amusing, but very \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n150 \n\n\nsuperficial girl, who has nothing to do with the Anne of \ntoday. Peter said quite rightly about me: “If ever I saw you, \nyou were always surrounded by two or more boys and a \nwhole troupe of girls. You were always laughing and always \nthe center of everything!” \n\nWhat is left of this girl? Oh, don't worry, I haven't for- \ngotten how to laugh or to answer back readily. I'm just as \ngood, if not better, at criticizing people, and I can still flirt \nif ... I wish. That’s not it though, I’d like that sort of life \nagain for an evening, a few days, or even a week, the life \nwhich seems so carefree and gay. But at the end of that \nweek, I should be dead beat and would be only too thankful \nto listen to anyone who began to talk about something sen- \nsible. I don’t want followers, but friends, admirers who fall \nnot for a flattering smile but for what one does and for one’s \ncharacter. \n\nI know quite well that the circle around me would be \nmuch smaller. But what does that matter, as long as one still \nkeeps a few sincere friends? \n\nYet I wasn’t entirely happy in 1942 m spite of everything; \nI often felt deserted, but because I was on the go the whole \nday long, I didn’t think about it and enjoyed myself as much \nas I could. Consciously or unconsciously, I tried to drive \naway the emptiness I felt with jokes and pranks. Now I think \nseriously about life and what I have to do. One period of my \nlife is over forever. The carefree schooldays are gone, never \nto return. \n\nI don’t even long for them any more; I have outgrown \nthem, I can’t just only enjoy myself as my serious side is al- \nways there. \n\nI look upon my life up till the New Year, as it were, through \na powerful magnifying glass. The sunny life at home, then \ncoming here in 1942, the sudden change, the quarrels, the \nbickerings. I couldn’t understand it, I was taken by surprise, \nand the only way I could keep up some bearing was by being \nimpertinent. \n\nThe first half of 1943. my fits of crying, the loneliness, how \nI slowly began to see all my faults and shortcomings, which \n\n\n\n151 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nare so great and which seemed much greater then. During \nthe day I deliberately talked about anything and everything \nthat was farthest from my thoughts, tried to draw Pim to me; \nbut couldn't. Alone I had to face the difficult task of chang- \ning myself, to stop the everlasting reproaches, which were so \noppressive and which reduced me to such terrible despond- \nency. \n\nThings improved slightly in the second half of the year, I \nbecame a young woman and was treated more like a grownup. \nI started to think, and write stories, and came to the con- \nclusion that the others no longer had the right to throw \nme about like an india-rubber ball. I wanted to change in \naccordance with my own desires. But one thing that struck \nme even more was when I realized that even Daddy would \nnever become my confidant over everything. I didn’t want to \ntrust anyone but myself any more. \n\nAt the beginning of the New Year: the second great \nchange, my dream. . . . And with it I discovered my longing, \nnot for a girl friend, but for a boy friend. I also discovered \nmy inward happiness and my defensive armor of superficiality \nand gaiety. In due time I quieted down and discovered my \nboundless desire for all that is beautiful and good. \n\nAnd in the evening, when I lie in bed and end my prayers \nwith the words, “I thank you, God, for all that is good and \ndear and beautiful,” I am filled with joy. Then I think about \n“the good” of going into hiding, of my health and with \nmy whole being of the “dearness” of Peter, of that which \nis still embryonic and impressionable and which we neither \nof us dare to name or touch, of that which will come some- \ntime; love, the future, happiness and of \"the beauty” which \nexists in the world; the world, nature, beauty and all, all that \nis exquisite and fine. \n\nI don’t think then of all the misery, hut of the beauty that \nstill remains. This is one of the things that Mummy and I \nare so entirely different about. Her counsel when one feels \nmelancholy is: \"Think of all the misery in the world and be \nthankful that you are not sharing in it!” My advice is: \"Go \noutside, to the fields, enjoy nature and the sunshine, go out \n\n\n\n152 \n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\nand try to recapture happiness in yourself and in God. Think \nof all the beauty that's still left in and around you and be \nhappy!” \n\nI don’t see how Mummy’s idea can be right, because then \nhow are you supposed to behave if you go through the misery \nyourself? Then you are lost. On the contrary, I’ve found \nthat there is always some beauty left-in nature, sunshine, \nfreedom, in yourself; these can all help you. Look at these \nthings, then you find yourself again, and God, and then you \nregain your balance. \n\nAnd whoever is happy will make others happy too. He \nwho has courage and faith will never perish in misery! \n\nYours, Anne",

Its not half \nenough though and I ask myself why it is that I always long \nfor more. He used to think I was unbearable; and I returned \nthe compliment; now I have changed my opinion, has he \nchanged his too? \n\nI think so; still it doesn’t necessarily mean that we shall \nbecome great friends, although as far as I am concerned it \nwould make the time here much more bearable. But still, \nI won’t get myself upset about it— I see quite a lot of^him \nand there’s no need to make you unhappy about it too, Kitty, \njust because I feel so miserable. \n\nOn Saturday afternoon I felt in such a whirl, after hearing \na whole lot of sad news, that I went and lay on my divan for \na sleep. I only wanted to sleep to stop myself thinking. I slept \ntill four o’clock, then I had to go into the living room. I \nfound it difficult to answer all Mummy’s questions and think \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n153 \n\n\nof some little excuse to tell Daddy, as an explanation for \nmy long sleep. I resorted to a “headache,” which wasn't a lie, \nas I had one . . . but insidel \n\nOrdinary people, ordinary girls, teen-agers like myself, will \nthink fm a bit cracked with all my self-pity. Yes, that's \nwhat it is, but I pour out my heart to you, then for the rest \nof the day I’m as impudent, gay, and self-confident as I can \nbe, in order to avoid questions and getting on my own nerves. \n\nMargot is very sweet and would like me to trust her, but \nstill, I can't tell her everything. She's a darling, she's good \nand pretty, but she lacks the nonchalance for conducting \ndeep discussions; she takes me so seriously, much too seri- \nously, and then thinks about her queer little sister for a long \ntime afterwards, looks searchingly at me, at every word I say, \nand keeps on thinking: “Is this just a joke or does she really \nmean it?” I think that's because we are together the whole \nday long, and that if I trusted someone completely, then \nI shouldn’t want them hanging around me all the time. \n\nWhen shall I finally untangle my thoughts, when shall I \nfind peace and rest within myself again? \n\nYours, Ann©",

        "original_text": "Tuesday , 14 March , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nPerhaps it would be entertaining for you— though not in \nthe least for me-to hear what we are going to eat today. As \nthe charwoman is at work downstairs. I'm sitting on the \nVan Daans' table at the moment. I have a handkerchief \nsoaked m some good scent (bought before we came here) \nover my mouth and held against my nose. You won't gather \nmuch Rom this, so let's “begin at the beginning.\" \n\nThe people from whom we obtained food coupons have \nbeen caught, so we just have our five ration cards and no \nextra coupons, and no fats. As both Miep and Koophuis are \nill, Elli hasn’t time to do any shopping, so the atmosphere \nis dreary and dejected, and so is the food. From tomorrow \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n154 \n\n\nwe shall not have a scrap of fat, butter, or margarine left. We \ncan't have fried potatoes (to save bread) for breakfast any \nlonger, so we have porridge instead, and as Mrs. Van Daan \nthinks were starving, we have bought some full cream mflV \n“under the counter,\" Our supper today consists of a hash \nmade from kale which has been preserved in a barrel. Hence \nthe precautionary measure with the handkerchief! It's in- \ncredible how kale can stink when it's a year old! The smell \nin the room is a mixture of bad plums, strong preservatives, \nand rotten eggs. Ugh! the mere thought of eating that muck \nmakes me feel sick. \n\nAdded to this, our potatoes are suffering from such peculiar \ndiseases that out of two buckets of pommes de terre , one \nwhole one ends up on the stove. We amuse ourselves by \nsearching for all the different kinds of diseases, and have \ncome to the conclusion that they range from cancer and \nsmallpox to measles! Oh, no, its no joke to be in hiding \nduring the fourth year of the war. If only the whole rotten \nbusiness was over! \n\nQuite honestly, I wouldn't care so much about the food, \nif only it were more pleasant here in other ways. There's the \nrub. this tedious existence is beginning to make us all touchy. \n\nThe following are the views of the five grownups on the \npresent situation: \n\nMrs. Van Daan: “The job as queen of the kitchen lost its \nattraction a long time ago. It's dull to sit and do nothing, \nso I go back to my cooking again. Still, I have to complain \nthat it’s impossible to cook without any fats, and all these \nnasty smells make me feel sick. Nothing but ingratitude and \nrude remarks do I get in return for my services. I am always \nthe black sheep, always the guilty one. Moreover, according \nto me, very little progress is being made in the war, in the \nend the Germans will still win. I’m afraid were going to \nstarve, and if I'm in a had mood I scold everyone.\" \n\nMr. Van Daan: “I must smoke and smoke and smoke, and \nthen the food, the political situation, and Kerli's moods \ndon't seem so had. Kerli is a darling wife.” \n\nBut if he hasn't anything to smoke, then nothing is right, \n\n\n\n155 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nand this is what one hears: Tm getting ill, we don’t live \nwell enough, I must have meat. Frightfully stupid person, \nmy Kerli!” After this a terrific quarrel is sure to follow. \n\nMrs. Frank: \"Food is not very important, but I would \nlove a slice of rye bread now, I feel so terribly hungry. If I \nwere Mrs. Van Daan I would have put a stop to Mr. Van \nDaan’s everlasting smoking a long time ago. But now I must \ndefinitely have a cigarette, because my nerves are getting \nthe better of me. The English make a lot of mistakes, but \nstill the war is progressing. I must have a chat and be thank- \nful Im not in Poland” \n\nMr. Frank. \"Everything’s all right. I don’t require any- \nthing. Take it easy, we’ve ample time. Give me my potatoes \nand then I will keep my mouth shut. Put some of my rations \non one side for Elli. The political situation is very promis- \ning, I’m extremely optimistic!” \n\nMr. Dussel: \"I must get my task for today, everything must \nbe finished on time. Political situation ‘outschtanding’ and it \nis eempossible’ that we’ll be caught. \n\n“I, I, I ... 1” \n\nYours, Anne",

Today I hear nothing but \"if this or that \nshould happen, then we are going to be in difficulties . . . \nif he or she should become ill, then we’ll be completely \nisolated, and then if . . .” Enfin, I expect you know the rest, \nat least I presume you know the \"Secret Annexers” well \nenough by this time to be able to guess the trend of their \nconversations. \n\nThe reason for all this \"if, if” is that Mr. Kraler has been \ncalled up to go digging. Elli has a streaming cold and will \nprobably have to stay at home tomorrow. Miep hasn’t fully \nrecovered from her flu yet, and Koophuis has had such bad \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK 156 \n\nhemorrhage of the stomach that he lost consciousness. What \na tale of woe! \n\nThe warehouse people are getting a free day tomorrow; \nElli can stay at home, then the door will remain locked \nand we shall have to be as quiet as mice, so that the neigh- \nbors don’t hear us. Henk is coming to visit the deserted ones \nat one o’clock-playing the role of zoo-keeper, as it were. \nFor the first time in ages he told us something about the \ngreat wide world this afternoon. You should have seen the \neight of us sitting around him; it looked exactly like a picture \nof grandmother telling a story. He talked nineteen to the \ndozen to his grateful audience about food, of course, and \nthen Miep’s doctor, and everything that we asked about. \n“Doctor,” he said, “don’t talk to me about the doctor! I rang \nhim up this morning, had his assistant on the phone and \nasked for a prescription for flu. The reply was that I could \ncome and get the prescription any time between eight and \nnine in the morning. If you have a very bad attack of flu, \nthe doctor comes to the telephone himself and says Tut out \nyour tongue, say Aah, I can hear all right that your throat is \ninflamed. I’ll write out a prescription for you to order from \nthe chemist. Good-by.’ And that’s that.” A fine practice that, \nrun by telephone only. \n\nRut I don’t want to criticize the doctors; after all, a person \nhas but two hands, and in these days there’s an abundance of \npatients and very few doctors to cope with them. Still, we \ncouldn’t help laughing when Henk repeated the telephone \nconversation to us. \n\nI can just imagine what a doctor’s waiting room must look \nlike nowadays. One doesn’t look down on panel patients any \nmore, but on the people with minor ailments, and thinks: “Hi, \nyou, what are you doing here, end of the line, please; urgent \ncases have priority!” \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\n157 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 16 March , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nThe weather is lovely, superb, I can’t describe it; I’m going \nup to the attic in a minute. \n\nNow I know why I’m so much more restless than Peter. He \nhas his own room where he can work, dream, think, and sleep. \nI am shoved about from one corner to another. I hardly spend \nany time in my “double” room and yet it’s something I long \nfor so much. That is the reason too why I so frequently escape \nto the attic. There, and with you, I can be myself for a while, \njust a little while. Still, I don’t want to moan about myself, on \nthe contrary, I want to be brave. Thank goodness the others \ncan’t tell what my inward feelings are, except that I’m grow- \ning cooler towards Mummy daily, I’m not so affectionate to \nDaddy and don’t tell Margot a single thing. I’m completely \nclosed up. Above all, I must maintain my outward reserve, no \none must know that war still reigns incessantly within. War \nbetween desire and common sense. The latter has won up till \nnow; yet will the former prove to be the stronger of the two? \nSometimes I fear that it will and sometimes I long for it to be! \n\nOh, it is so terribly difficult never to say anything to Peter, \nbut I know that the first to begm must be he; there’s so much \nI want to say and do, I’ve lived it all in my dreams, it is so \nhard to find that yet another day has gone by, and none of it \ncomes true! Yes, Kitty, Anne is a crazy child, but I do live in \ncrazy times and under still crazier circumstances. \n\nBut, still, the brightest spot of all is that at least I can write \ndown my thoughts and feelings, otherwise I would be abso- \nlutely stifled! I wonder what Peter thinks about all these \nthings? I keep hoping that I can talk about it to him one day. \nThere must be something he has guessed about me, because \nhe certainly can’t love the outer Anne, which is the one he \nknows so far. \n\nHow can he, who loves peace and quiet, have any liking for \nall my bustle and din? Can he possibly be the first and only \none to have looked through my concrete armor? And will it \ntake him long to get there? Isn’t there an old saying that love \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n158 \n\n\noften springs from pity, or that the two go hand in hand? Is \nthat the case with me too? Because I’m often just as sorry for \nhim as I am for myself. \n\nI really don t honestly know how to begin, and however \nwould he be able to, when he finds talking so much more dif- \nficult than I do? If only I could write to him, then at least I \nwould know that he would grasp what I want to say, because \nits so terribly difficult to put it into words! \n\nYours, Anne",

Elli has \ngiven her nose a talking to and strictly forbidden it to be a \nnuisance to her today. So everything is all right again, except \nthat Margot and I are getting a bit tired of our parents. Don’t \nmisunderstand me, I can’t get on well with Mummy at the \nmoment, as you know. I still love Daddy just as much, and \nMargot loves Daddy and Mummy, but when you are as old as \nwe are, you do want to decide just a few things for yourself, \nyou want to be independent sometimes. \n\nIf I go upstairs, then I’m asked what I’m going to do, I’m \nnot allowed salt with my food, every evening regularly at a \nquarter past eight Mummy asks whether I ought not to start \nundressing, every book I read must be inspected. I must admit \nthat they are not at all strict, and I’m allowed to read nearly \neverything, and yet we are both sick of all the remarks plus \nall the questioning that go on the whole day long. \n\nSomething else, especially about me, that doesn’t please \nthem: I don’t feel like giving lots of kisses any more and I \nthink fancy nicknames are terribly affected. In short, I’d really \nlike to be rid of them for a while. Margot said last evening, \"I \nthink it’s awfully annoying, the way they ask if you’ve got a \nheadache, or whether you don’t feel well, if you happen to \ngive a sigh and put your hand to your head!” \n\n\n\n159 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nIt is a great blow to us both, suddenly to realize how little \nremains of the confidence and harmony that we used to have \nat home. And it’s largely due to the fact that were all “skew- \nwiff” here. By this I mean that we are treated as children over \noutward things, and we are much older than most girls of our \nage inwardly. \n\nAlthough I’m only fourteen, I know quite well what I want, \nI know who is right and who is wrong, I have my opinions, \nmy own ideas and principles, and although it may sound \npretty mad from an adolescent, I feel more of a person than a \nchild, I feel quite independent of anyone. \n\nI know that I can discuss things and argue better than \nMummy, I know I’m not so prejudiced, I don’t exaggerate so \nmuch, I am more precise and adroit and because of this— you \nmay laugh-I feel superior to her over a great many things. If \nI love anyone, above all I must have admiration for them, ad- \nmiration and respect. Everything would be all right if only I \nhad Peter, for I do admire him in many ways. He is such a \nnice, good-looking boy! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Sunday , 19 March , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nYesterday was a great day for me. I had decided to talk \nthings out with Peter. Just as we were going to sit down to \nsupper I whispered to him, “Are you going to do shorthand \nthis evening, Peter?” “No,” was his reply. “Then I’d just like \nto talk to you later!” He agreed. After the dishes were done, I \nstood by the window in his parents’ room awhile for the look \nof things, but it wasn’t long before I went to Peter. He was \nstanding on the left side of the open window, I went and stood \non the right side, and we talked. It was much easier to talk \nbeside the open window in semidarkness than in bright light, \nand I believe Peter felt the same. \n\nWe told each other so much, so very very much, that I cant \nrepeat it all, but it was lovely; the most wonderful evening I \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n160 \n\n\nhave ever had in the \"Secret Annexe/’ I will just tell you brief- \nly the various things we talked about. First we talked about \nthe quarrels and how I regard them quite differently now, and \nthen about the estrangement between us and our parents. \n\nI told Peter about Mummy and Daddy, and Margot, and \nabout myself. \n\nAt one moment he asked, \"I suppose you always give each \nother a good night kiss, don’t you?” \n\n“One, dozens, why, don’t you?” \n\n“No, I have hardly ever kissed anyone.” \n\n“Not even on your birthday?” \n\n“Yes, I have then.” \n\nWe talked about how we neither of us confide in our par- \nents, and how his parents would have loved to have his con- \nfidence, but that he didn’t wish it. How I cry my heart out in \nbed, and he goes up into the loft and swears. How Margot and \nI really only know each other well for a little while, but that, \neven so, we don’t tell each other everything, because we are \nalways together. Over every imaginable thing— oh, he was just \nas I thought! \n\nThen we talked about 1942, how different we were then. \nWe just don’t recognize ourselves as the same people any \nmore. How we simply couldn’t bear each other in the begin- \nning. He thought I was much too talkative and unruly, and I \nsoon came to the conclusion that I’d no time for him. I couldn’t \nunderstand why he didn’t flirt with me, but now I’m glad. He \nalso mentioned how much he isolated himself from us all. I \nsaid that there was not much difference between my noise and \nhis silence. That I love peace and quiet too, and have nothing \nfor myself alone, except my diary. How glad he is that my \nparents have children here, and that I’m glad he is here. That \nI understand his reserve now and his relationship with his \nparents, and how I would love to be able to help him. \n\n“You always do help me,” he said. “How?” I asked, very \nsurprised. “By your cheerfulness.” That was certainly the \nloveliest thing he said. It was wonderful, he must have grown \nto love me as a friend, and that is enough for the time being. \n\n\n\nthe diary of a young girl xei \n\nI am so grateful and happy, I just can't find the words. I must \napologize, Kitty, that my style is not up to standard today. \n\nI have just written down what came into my head. I have \nthe feeling now that Peter and I share a secret. If he looks at \nme with those eyes that laugh and wink, then it's just as if a \nlittle light goes on inside me, I hope it will remain like this \nand that we may have many, many more glorious times to- \ngether! \n\nYour grateful, happy Anne",

        "original_text": "Monday , 20 March , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nThis morning Peter asked me if I would come again one \nevening, and said that I really didn’t disturb him, and if \nthere’s room for one there’s room for two. I said that I couldn’t \ncome every evening, because they wouldn’t like it downstairs, \nhut he thought that I needn’t let that bother me. Then I said \nthat I would love to come one Saturday evening and especial- \nly asked him to warn me when there was a moon. “Then we’ll \ngo downstairs,” he answered, “and look at the moon from \nthere.” \n\nIn the meantime a little shadow has fallen on my happiness. \nI’ve thought for a long time that Margot liked Peter quite a \nlot too. How much she loves him I don’t know, hut I think it’s \nwretched. I must cause her terrible pain each time Im with \nPeter, and the funny part of it is that she hardly shows it. \n\nI know quite well that I’d be desperately jealous, but \nMargot only says that I needn’t pity her. \n\n“I think it’s so rotten that you should be the odd one out,” \nI added. “I’m used to that,” she answered, somewhat bitterly. \n\nI don’t dare tell Peter this yet, perhaps later on, but we’ve \ngot to talk about so many other things first. \n\nI had a little ticking off. yesterday evening from Mummy, \nwhich I certainly deserved. I mustn’t overdo my indifference \ntowards her. So in spite of everything, I must try once again \nto be friendly and keep my observations to myself. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n162 \n\n\nEven Pim is different lately. He is trying not to treat me \nas such a child, and it makes him much too cool. See what \ncomes of it! \n\nEnough for now, I’m full to the brim with Peter and can \ndo nothing but look at him! \n\nEvidence of Margot’s goodness: I received this today, \n\nMarch 20th , 1944 \n\nAnne, when 1 said yesterday that 1 was not jealous of you 1 was \nonly fifty per cent honest. It is like this ; Ym jealous of neither you \nnor Peter. I only feel a bit sorry that 1 haven’t found anyone yet, \nand am not likely to for the time being, with whom I can discuss \nmy thoughts and feelings. But 1 should not grudge it to you for \nthat reason. One misses enough here anyway, things that other peo- \nple just take for granted. \n\nOn the other hand, 1 know for certain that 1 would never have \ngot so far with Peter, anyway, because 1 have the feeling that if 1 \nwished to discuss a lot with anyone, l should want to be on rather \nintimate terms with him. I would want to have the feeling that he \nunderstood me through and through without my having to say \nmuch. But for that reason it would have to be someone whom 1 \nfelt was my superior intellectually, and that is not the case with \nPeter. But 1 can imagine it being so with you and Peter. \n\nYou are not doing me out of anything which is my due; do not \nreproach yourself in the least on my account. You and Peter can \nonly gain by the friendship. \n\nMy reply: \n\nDear Margot, \n\nI thought your letter was exceptionally sweet, but I still don’t \nfeel quite happy about it and nor do I think that I shall. \n\nAt present there is no question of such confidence as you have in \nmind between Peter and myself, but in the twilight beside an open \nwindow you can say more to each other than in brilliant sunshine. \nAlso it’s easier to whisper your feelings than to trumpet them forth \nout loud. I believe that you are beginning to feel a kind of sisterly \naffection for Peter, and that you would love to help him, just as \nmuch as 1. Perhaps you will still be able to do that sometime, al- \nthough that is not the kind of confidence we have in mind. I think \nit must come from both sides, and 1 believe that’s the reason why \nDaddy and I have never got so far. \n\nLet’s not talk about it any more, but if you still want anything \n\n\n\n163 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nplease write to me about it, because 1 can say what 1 mean muck \nbetter on paper. \n\nYou don't know how much I admire you, and I only hope that I \nmay yet acquire some of the goodness that you and Daddy have , \nbecause now 1 don't see much difference between you and Daddy \nin that sense. \n\nYours, Anne",

In my heart of hearts I feel that I have \nthe right to share mutual confidence with someone , but 1 could not \nbear Peter in that role yet. \n\nHowever , I do feel just as you say, that Peter is a bit like a \nbrother, but— a younger brother; we have put out feelers towards \neach other, the affection of a brother and sister might grow if they \ntouched, perhaps they will later— perhaps never, however, it has \ncertainly not reached that stage yet. \n\nTherefore you really needn't pity me Now that you've found \ncompanionship , enjoy it as much as you can. \n\nIn the meantime it is getting more and more wonderful \nhere. I believe, Kitty, that we may have a real great love in \nthe “Secret Annexe.” Don't worry, I’m not thinking of marry- \ning him. I don’t know what he will be like when he grows up, \nnor do I know whether we should ever love each other enough \nto marry. I know now that Peter loves me, but just how I my- \nself don’t know yet. \n\nWhether he only wants a great friend, or whether I attract \nhim as a girl or as a sister, I can’t yet discover. \n\nWhen he said that I always helped him over his parents’ \nquarrels, I was awfully glad; it was one step towards making \nme believe in his friendship. I asked him yesterday what he \nwould do if there were a dozen Annes here who always kept \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n164 \n\n\ncoming to him. His reply was, “If they were all like you, it cer- \ntainly wouldn’t be too bad!” He’s tremendously hospitable to- \nwards me and I really believe he likes to see me. Meanwhile \nhe is working diligently at his French, even when he's m bed, \ngoing on until a quarter past ten. Oh, when I think about \nSaturday evening and recall it all, word for word, then for the \nfirst time I don’t feel discontented about myself; I mean that I \nwould still say exactly the same and wouldn’t wish to change \nanything, as is usually the case. \n\nHe is so handsome, both when he laughs and when he looks \nquietly in front of him; he is such a darling and so good. I be- \nlieve what surprised him most about me was when he discov- \nered that I’m not a bit the superficial worldly Anne that I \nappear, but just as dreamy a specimen, with just as many dif- \nficulties as he himself. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nReply; \n\n\nDear Margot, \n\n1 think the best thing we can do is simply to wait and see what \nhappens. It cant be very long before Peter and I come to a definite \ndecision , either to go on as before or he different. Just which way \nit will go I dont know myself , and 1 dont bother to look beyond \nmy own nose . But I shall certainly do one thing, if Peter and I de- \ncide to be friends, 1 shall tell him that you are very fond of him too \nand would always be prepared to help him should the need arise. \nThe latter may not be what you wish, but I dont care now, 1 dont \nknow what Peter thinks about you, but 1 shall ask him then. \n\nTm sure it's not bad-ihe oppositel You are always welcome to \njoin us in the attic, or wherever we are, you honestly wont disturb \nus because 1 feel we have a silent agreement to talk only in the \nevenings when ifs dark. \n\nKeep your courage up f Like 1 do. Although ifs not always easy; \nyour time may come sooner than you think. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\n1 65 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 23 March , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nThings are running more or less normally again now. \nOur coupon men are out of prison again, thank goodness! \n\nMiep returned yesterday. EJli is better, although she still \nhas a cough; Koophuis will have to stay at home for a long \ntime still. \n\nA plane crashed near here yesterday; the occupants were \nable to jump out in time by parachute. The machine crashed \nonto a school, but there were no children there at the time. \nThe result was a small fire and two people killed. The Ger- \nmans shot at the airmen terribly as they were coming down. \nThe Amsterdammers who saw it nearly exploded with rage \nand indignation at the cowardliness of such a deed. We— Im \nspeaking of the ladies— nearly jumped out of our skins, I loathe \nthe blasted shooting. \n\nI often go upstairs after supper nowadays and take a breath \nof the fresh evening air. I like it up there, sitting on a chair \nbeside him and looking outside. \n\nVan Daan and Dussel make very feeble remarks when I \ndisappear into his room; \"Anne’s second home,” they call it, or \n“Is it suitable for young gentlemen to receive young girls in \nsemidarkness?” Peter shows amazing wit in his replies to these \nso-called humorous sallies. For that matter, Mummy too is \nsomewhat curious and would love to ask what we talk about, \nif she wasn’t secretly afraid of being snubbed. Peter says it’s \nnothing but envy on the part of the grownups, because we are \nyoung and we don’t pay much attention to their spitefulness. \nSometimes he comes and gets me from downstairs, but he \nturns simply scarlet in spite of all precautions, and can hardly \nget the words out of his mouth. How thankful I am that I \ndon’t blush, it must be a highly unpleasant sensation. Daddy \nalways says Im prudish and vain but that’s not true, I’m just \nsimply vain! I have not often had anyone tell me I was pretty. \nExcept a boy at school, who said I looked so attractive when I \nlaughed. Yesterday I received a genuine compliment from \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK 166 \n\nPeter, and fust for fun I will tell you roughly how the con- \nversation went: \n\nPeter so often used to say, “Do laugh, Anne!” This struck \nme as odd, and I asked, “Why must I always laugh?” \n\n“Because I like it; you get such dimples in your cheeks \nwhen you laugh; how do they come, actually?” \n\n“I was bom with them. I’ve got one in my chin too. That’s \nmy only beauty!” \n\n“Of course not, that’s not true.” \n\n“Yes, it is, I know quite well that I’m not a beauty; I never \nhave been and never shall be.” \n\n“I don’t agree at all, I think you’re pretty.” \n\n“That’s not true.” \n\n“If I say so, then you can take it from me it is!” \n\nThen I naturally said the same of him. \n\nI hear a lot from all sides about the sudden friendship. We \ndon’t take much notice of all this parental chatter, their re- \nmarks are so feeble. Have the two sets of parents forgotten \ntheir own youth? It seems like it, at least they seem to take us \nseriously, if we make a joke, and laugh at us when we are seri- \nous. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Monday , 27 March , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nOne very big chapter of our history in hiding should really \nbe about politics, but as this subject doesn’t interest me per- \nsonally very much, I’ve rather let it go. So for once I will de- \nvote my whole letter to politics today. \n\nIt goes without saying that there are very many different \nopinions on this topic, and it’s even more logical that it should \nbe a favorite subject for discussion in such critical times, but— \nit’s just simply stupid that there should be so many quarrels \nover it. \n\nThey may speculate, laugh, abuse, and grumble, let them \ndo what they will, as long as they stew in their own juice and \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n167 \n\n\ndon't quarrel, because the consequences are usually unpleas- \nant. \n\nThe people from outside bring with them a lot of news that \nis not true; however, up till now our radio set hasn't lied to us. \nHebk, Miep, Koophuis, Elli, and Kraler all show ups and \ndowns in their political moods, Henk least of all \n\nPolitical feeling here in the \"Secret Annexe” is always about \nthe same. During the countless arguments over invasion, air \nraids, speeches, etc., etc., one also always hears the countless \ncries of \"impossible,” or “Um Gottes WiUen , if they are going \nto start now however long is it going to last?” \"It's going splen- \ndidly, first class, good!” Optimists and pessimists, and, above \nall, don’t let’s forget the realists who give their opinions with \nuntiring energy and, just as with everything else, each one \nthinking he is right. It annoys a certain lady that her spouse \nhas such unparalleled faith in the British, and a certain gentle- \nman attacks his lady because of her teasing and disparaging \nremarks about his beloved nation. \n\nThey never seem to tire of it, I have discovered something \n-the effects are stupendous, just like pricking someone with \na pin and waiting to see how they jump. This is what I do: \nbegin on politics. One question, one word, one sentence, and \nat once they're off! \n\nJust as if the German Wehrmacht news bulletins and the \nEnglish B.B.C. were not enough, they have now introduced \n“Special Air-Raid Announcements.” In one word, magnificent; \nbut on the other hand often disappointing too. The British are \nmaking a non-stop business of their air attacks, with the same \nzest as the Germans make a business of lying. The radio there- \nfore goes on early in the morning and is listened to at all hours \nof the day, until nine, ten, and often eleven o'clock in the eve- \nning. \n\nThis is certainly a sign that the grownups have infinite pa- \ntience, but it also means the power of absorption of their \nbrains is pretty limited, with exceptions, of course— I don't \nwant to hurt anyone's feelings. One or two news bulletins \nwould be ample per day! But the old geese, well— I've said \nmy piece! \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n168 \n\n\nArbeiter-Programm, Radio “Oranje,” Frank Phillips or Her \nMajesty Queen Wilheknina, they each get their turn, and an \never attentive ear. And if they are not eating or sleeping, then \nthey re sitting around the radio and discussing food, sleep, \nand politics. \n\nUgh! It gets so boring, and it’s quite a job not to become \na dull old stick oneself. Politics can't do much more harm to \nthe parents! \n\nI must mention one shining exception-a speech by our be- \nloved Winston Churchill is quite perfect. \n\nNine o'clock on Sunday evening. The teapot stands, with \nthe cozy over it, on the table, and the guests come in. Dussel \nnext to the radio on the left, Mr. Van Daan in front of it, with \nPeter beside him. Mummy next to Mr. Van Daan and Mrs. Van \nDaan behind him, and Pirn at the table, Margot and I beside. \nI see I haven't described very clearly how we sit. The gentle- \nmen puff away at their pipes, Peter’s eyes are popping out of \nhis head with the strain of listening. Mummy wearing a long \ndark negligee, and Mrs. Van Daan trembling because of the \nplanes, which take no notice of the speech but fly blithely on \ntowards Essen, Daddy sipping tea, Margot and I united in a \nsisterly fashion by the sleeping Mouschi, who is monopolizing \nboth our knees. Margot’s hair is in curlers, I am wearing a \nnightdress, which is much too small, too narrow, and too \nshort. \n\nIt all looks so intimate, snug, peaceful, and this time it is \ntoo, yet I await the consequences with horror. They can hard- \nly wait till the end of the speech, stamping their feet, so im- \npatient are they to get down to discussing it. Brr, brr, brr- \nthey egg each other on until the arguments lead to discord \nand quarrels. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Tuesday , 28 March, 1944 \n\n\nDearest Kitty, \n\nI could write a lot more about politics, but I have heaps of \n\n\n\n169 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nother things to tell you today. First, Mummy has more or less \nforbidden me to go upstairs so often, because, according to \nher, Mrs. Van Daan is jealous. Secondly, Peter has invited \nMargot to join us upstairs; I don't know whether it's just out \nof politeness or whether he really means it. Thirdly, I went \nand asked Daddy if he thought I need pay any regard to Mrs. \nVan Daan's jealousy, and he didn’t think so. What next? Mum- \nmy is cross, perhaps jealous too. Daddy doesn't grudge us \nthese times together, and thinks it’s nice that we get on so \nwell. Margot is fond of Peter too, but feels that two’s company \nand three’s a crowd. \n\nMummy thinks that Peter is in love with me; quite frankly, \nI only wish he were, then we’d be quits and really be able to \nget to know each other. She also says that he keeps on looking \nat me. Now, I suppose that’s true, but still I can’t help it if \nhe looks at my dimples and we wink at each other occasional- \nly, can I? \n\nI’m in a very difficult position. Mummy is against me and \nI’m against her, Daddy closes his eyes and tries not to see the \nsilent battle between us. Mummy is sad, because she does \nreally love me, while I’m not in the least bit sad, because I \ndon’t think she understands. And Peter-I don't want to give \nPeter up, he’s such a darling. I admire him so; it can grow into \nsomething beautiful between us; why do the “old ’uns” have \nto poke their noses in all the time? Luckily I'm quite used to \nhiding my feelings and I manage extremely well not to let \nthem see how mad I am about him. Will he ever say anything? \nWill I ever feel his cheek against mine, like I felt Petel’s cheek \nin my dream? Oh, Peter and Petel, you are one and the samel \nThey don’t understand us; won’t they ever grasp that we are \nhappy, just sitting together and not saying a word. They don't \nunderstand what has driven us together like this. Oh, when \nwill all these difficulties be overcome? And yet it is good to \novercome them, because then the end will be all the more \nwonderful. When he lies with his head on his arm with his \neyes closed, then he is still a child; when he plays with Boche, \nhe is loving; when he carries potatoes or anything heavy, then \nhe is strong; when he goes and watches the shooting, or looks \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n170 \n\n\nfor burglars in the darkness, then he is brave; and when he is \nso awkward and clumsy, then he is just a pet. \n\nI like it much better if he explains something to me than \nwhen I have to teach him; I would really adore him to be my \nsuperior in almost everything. \n\nWhat do we care about the two mothers? Oh, but if only he \nwould speak! \n\nYours, Anne",

Of course, they all made a \nrush at my diary immediately. Just imagine how interesting it \nwould be if I were to publish a romance of the “Secret An- \nnexe.” The title 1 alone would be enough to make people think \nit was a detective story. \n\nBut, seriously, it would seem quite funny ten years after the \nwar if we Jews were to tell how we lived and what we ate and \ntalked about here. Although I tell you a lot, still, even so, you \nonly know very little of our lives. \n\nHow scared the ladies are during the air raids. For instance, \non Sunday, when 350 British planes dropped half a million \nkilos of bombs on Ijmuiden, how the houses trembled like a \nwisp of grass in the wind, and who knows how many epidem- \nics now rage. You don't know anything about all these things, \nand I would need to keep on writing the whole day if I were \nto tell you everything in detail. People have to line up for \nvegetables and all kinds of other things; doctors are unable to \nvisit the sick, because if they turn their backs on their cars for \na moment, they are stolen; burglaries and thefts abound, so \nmuch so that you wonder what has taken hold of the Dutch for \nthem suddenly to have become such thieves. Little children of \n\n^•The original title of this diary was Het Achterhms There is no exact trans- \nlation into English, the nearest being The Secret Annexe \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n171 \n\n\neight and eleven years break the windows of people's homes \nand steal whatever they can lay their hands on. No one dares \nto leave his house unoccupied for five minutes, because if you \ngo, your things go too. Every day there are announcements in \nthe newspapers offering rewards for the return of lost prop- \nerty, typewriters, Persian rugs, electric clocks, cloth, etc., etc. \nElectric clocks in the streets are dismantled, public telephones \nare pulled to pieces— down to the last thread. Morale among \nthe population cant be good, the weekly rations are not \nenough to last for two days except the coffee substitute. The \ninvasion is a long time coming, and the men have to go to \nGermany. The children are ill or undernourished, everyone is \nwearing old clothes and old shoes. A new sole costs 7.50 florins \nin the black market; moreover, hardly any of the shoemakers \nwill accept shoe repairs or, if they do, you have to wait \nmonths, during which time the shoes often disappear. \n\nThere’s one good thing in the midst of it all, which is that \nas the food gets worse and the measures against the people \nmore severe, so sabotage against the authorities steadily in- \ncreases. The people m the food offices, the police, officials, \nthey all either work with their fellow citizens and help them \nor they tell tales on them and have them sent to prison. For- \ntunately, only a small percentage of Dutch people are on the \nwrong side. \n\nYours, Anne",

When I talk of \"food cycles” I \nmean periods in which one has nothing else to eat but one \nparticular dish or kind of vegetable. We had nothing but en- \ndive for a long time, day in, day out, endive with sand, endive \nwithout sand, stew with endive, boiled or en casserole; then it \nwas spinach, and after that followed kohlrabi, salsify, cucum- \nbers, tomatoes, sauerkraut, etc., etc. \n\nFor instance, it's really disagreeable to eat a lot of sauer- \nkraut for lunch and supper every day, but you do it if you re \nhungry. However, we have the most delightful period of all \nnow, because we don't get any fresh vegetables at all. Our \nweekly menu for supper consists of kidney beans, pea soup, \npotatoes with dumplings, potato-chalet and, by the grace of \nGod, occasionally turnip tops or rotten carrots, and then the \nkidney beans once again. We eat potatoes at every meal, be- \nginning with breakfast, because of the bread shortage. We \nmake our soup from kidney or haricot beans, potatoes, Juli- \nenne soup in packets, French beans in packets, kidney beans \nin packets. Everything contains beans, not to mention the \nbread! \n\nIn the evening we always have potatoes with gravy substi- \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n174 \n\n\ntut© and-thank goodness weve still got it-beetroot salad.

        "original_text": "Tuesday , 4 April, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nFor a long time I haven't had any idea of what I was work- \ning for any more; the end of the war is so terribly far away, \nso unreal, like a fairy tale. If the war isn't over by September \nI shan't go to school any more, because I don’t want to be \ntwo years behind. Peter filled my days-nothing but Peter, \ndreams and thoughts until Saturday, when I felt so utterly \nmiserable; oh, it was terrible. I was holding back my tears all \nthe while I was with Peter, then laughed with Van Daan over \nlemon punch, was cheerful and excited, but the moment I \nwas alone I knew that I would have to cry my heart out. So, \nclad in my nightdress, I let myself go and slipped down onto \nthe floor. First I said my long prayer very earnestly, then I \ncried with my head on my arms, my knees bent up, on the \nbare floor, completely folded up. One large sob brought me \nback to earth again, and I quelled my tears because I didn’t \nwant them to hear anything in the next room. Then I began \ntrying to talk some courage into myself. I could only say: “I \nmust, I must, I must . . Completely stiff from the unnatural \nposition, I fell against the side of the bed and fought on, until \nI climbed into bed again just before half past ten. It was over! \n\nAnd now it's all over. I must work, so as not to be a fool, to \nget on, to become a journalist, because that's what I want! I \nknow that I can write, a couple of my stories are good, my \ndescriptions of the “Secret Annexe” are humorous, there’s a \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 175 \n\nlot in my diary that speaks, but-whether I have real talent \nremains to be seen. \n\n\"Eva's Dream\" is my best fairy tale, and the queer thing \nabout it is that I don't know where it comes from. Quite a lot \nof “Cady's Life\" is good too, but, on the whole, it's nothing. \n\nI am the best and sharpest critic of my own work. I know \nmyself what is and what is not well written. Anyone who \ndoesn't write doesn't know how wonderful it is; I used to be- \nmoan the fact that I couldn't draw at all, but now I am more \nthan happy that I can at least write. And if I haven't any \ntalent for writing books or newspaper articles, well, then I can \nalways write for myself. \n\nI want to get on; I can't imagine that I would have to lead \nthe same sort of life as Mummy and Mrs. Van Daan and all \nthe women who do their work and are then forgotten. I must \nhave something besides a husband and children, something \nthat I can devote myself to! \n\nI want to go on living even after my death! And therefore \nI am grateful to God for giving me this gift, this possibility of \ndeveloping myself and of writing, of expressing all that is in \nme. \n\nI can shake off everything if I write; my sorrows disappear, \nmy courage is reborn. But, and that is the great question, will \nI ever be able to write anything great, will I ever become a \njournalist or a writer? I hope so, oh, I hope so very much, for \nI can recapture everything when I write, my thoughts, my \nideals and my fantasies. \n\nI haven't done anything more to “Cady's Life\" for ages; in \nmy mind I know exactly how to go on, but somehow it doesn't \nflow from my pen. Perhaps I never shall finish it, it may land \nup in the wastepaper basket, or the fire . . , that's a horrible \nidea, but then I think to myself, “At the age of fourteen and \nwith so little experience, how can you write about philosophy?\" \n\nSo I go on again with fresh courage; I think I shall succeed, \nbecause I want to write! \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n176",

I warn you, however, that there are heaps of \nthem, so don’t get a shock! \n\nFirst of all: writing, but that hardly counts as a hobby. \n\nNumber two: family trees. I’ve been searching for family \ntrees of the French, German, Spanish, English, Austrian, Rus- \nsian, Norwegian, and Dutch royal families in all the news- \npapers, books, and pamphlets I can find. I’ve made great \nprogress with a lot of them, as, for a long time already, I’ve \nbeen taking down notes from all the biographies and history \nbooks that I read; I even copy out many passages of history. \n\nMy third hobby then is history, on which Daddy has al- \nready bought me a lot of books. I can hardly wait for the day \nthat I shall be able to comb through the books in a public \nlibrary. \n\nNumber four is Greek and Roman mythology. I have vari- \nous books about this too. \n\nOther hobbies are film stars and family photos. Mad on \nbooks and reading. Have a great liking for history of art, poets \nand painters. I may go in for music later on. I have a great \nloathing for algebra, geometry, and figures. \n\nI enjoy all the other school subjects, but history above all! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Tuesday, 11 April , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMy head throbs, I honestly don’t know where to begin. \n\nOn Friday (Good Friday) we played Monopoly, Saturday \nafternoon too. These days passed quickly and uneventfully. \nOn Sunday afternoon, on my invitation, Peter came to my \nroom at half past four; at a quarter past five we went to the \nfront attic, where we remained until six o’clock. There was a \nbeautiful Mozart concert on the radio from six o’clock until a \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 177 \n\nquarter past seven. I enjoyed it all very much, but especially \nthe “Kleine Nachtmusik.” I can hardly listen in the room be- \ncause Im always so inwardly stirred when I hear lovely music. \n\nOn Sunday evening Peter and I went to the front attic to- \ngether and, in order to sit comfortably, we took with us a few \ndivan cushions that we were able to lay our hands on. We \nseated ourselves on one packing case. Both the case and the \ncushions were very narrow, so we sat absolutely squashed to- \ngether, leaning against other cases. Mouschi kept us company \ntoo, so we weren’t unchaperoned. \n\nSuddenly, at a quarter to nine, Mr. Van Daan whistled and \nasked if we had one of Dussel’s cushions. We both jumped up \nand went downstairs with cushion, cat, and Van Daan. \n\nA lot of trouble arose out of this cushion, because Dussel \nwas annoyed that we had one of his cushions, one that he used \nas a pillow. He was afraid that there might be fleas in it and \nmade a great commotion about his beloved cushion! Peter and \nI put two hard brushes in his bed as a revenge. We had a good \nlaugh over this little interlude! \n\nOur fun didn’t last long. At half past nine Peter knocked \nsoftly on the door and asked Daddy if he would just help him \nupstairs over a difficult English sentence. “That’s a blind,” I \nsaid to Margot, “anyone could see through that one!” I was \nright. They were in the act of breaking into the warehouse. \nDaddy, Van Daan, Dussel, and Peter were downstairs in a \nflash. Margot, Mummy, Mrs. Van Daan, and I stayed upstairs \nand waited. \n\nFour frightened women just have to talk, so talk we did, \nuntil we heard a bang downstairs. After that all was quiet, the \nclock struck a quarter to ten. The color had vanished from our \nfaces, we were still quiet, although we were afraid. Where \ncould the men be? What was that bang? Would they be fight- \ning the burglars? Ten o’clock, footsteps on the stairs: Daddy, \nwhite and nervous, entered, followed by Mr. Van Daan. \n“Lights out, creep upstairs, we expect the police in the house!” \n\nThere was no time to be frightened: the lights went out, I \nquickly grabbed a jacket, and we were upstairs. “What has \nhappened? Tell us quickly!” There was no one to tell us, the \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n178 \n\n\nmen having disappeared downstairs again. Only at ten past \nten did they reappear; two kept watch at Peter's open win- \ndow, the door to the landing was closed, the swinging cup- \nboard shut. We hung a jersey round the night light, and after \nthat they told us: \n\nPeter heard two loud bangs on the landing, ran downstairs, \nand saw there was a large plank out of the left half of the \ndoor. He dashed upstairs, warned the \"Home Guard\" of the \nfamily, and the four of them proceeded downstairs. When \nthey entered the warehouse, the burglars were in the act of \nenlarging the hole. Without further thought Van Daan \nshouted: “Police!\" \n\nA few hurried steps outside, and the burglars had fled. In \norder to avoid the hole being noticed by the police, a plank \nwas put against it, but a good hard kick from outside sent it \nflying to the ground. The men were perplexed at such im- \npudence, and both Van Daan and Peter felt murder welling \nup within them; Van Daan beat on the ground with a chop- \nper, and all was quiet again. Once more they wanted to put \nthe plank in front of the hole. Disturbance! A married couple \noutside shone a torch through the opening, lighting up the \nwhole warehouse. “Hell!” muttered one of the men, and now \nthey switched over from their role of police to that of burglars. \nThe four of them sneaked upstairs, Peter quickly opened the \ndoors and windows of the kitchen and private office, flung the \ntelephone onto the floor, and finally the four of them landed \nbehind the swinging cupboard. \n\nEND OF PART ONE \n\n\nThe married couple with the torch would probably have \nwarned the police: it was Sunday evening, Easter Sunday, no \none at the office on Easter Monday, so none of us could budge \nuntil Tuesday morning. Think of it, waiting in such fear for \ntwo nights and a day! No one had anything to suggest, so we \nsimply sat there in pitch-darkness, because Mrs. Van Daan in \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n179 \n\n\nher fright had unintentionally turned the lamp right out; \ntalked in whispers, and at every creak one heard “Shi sh!” \n\nIt turned half past ten, eleven, but not a sound; Daddy and \nVan Daan joined us in turns. Then a quarter past eleven, a \nbustle and noise downstairs. Everyone’s breath was audible, \notherwise no one moved. Footsteps in the house, in the private \noffice, kitchen, then ... on our staircase. No one breathed \naudibly now, footsteps on our staircase, then a rattling of the \nswinging cupboard. This moment is indescribable. “Now we \nare lost!” I said, and could see us all being taken away by the \nGestapo that very night. Twice they rattled at the cupboard, \nthen there was nothing, the footsteps withdrew, we were \nsaved so far. A shiver seemed to pass from one to another, I \nheard someone’s teeth chattering, no one said a word. \n\nThere was not another sound in the house, but a light was \nburning on our landing, right in front of the cupboard. Could \nthat be because it was a secret cupboard? Perhaps the police \nhad forgotten the light? Would someone come back to put it \nout? Tongues loosened, there was no one in the house any \nlonger, perhaps there was someone on guard outside. \n\nNext we did three things: we went over again what we sup- \nposed had happened, we trembled with fear, and we had to \ngo to the lavatory. The buckets were in the attic, so all we had \nwas Peter s tin wastepaper basket. Van Daan went first, then \nDaddy, but Mummy was too shy to face it. Daddy brought \nthe wastepaper basket into the room, where Margot, Mrs. \nVan Daan, and I gladly made use of it. Finally Mummy de- \ncided to do so too. People kept on asking for paper— fortunate- \nly I had some in my pocket! \n\nThe tin smelled ghastly, everything went on in a whisper, \nwe were tired, it was twelve o’clock. “Lie down on the floor \nthen and sleep.” Margot and I were each given a pillow and \none blanket; Margot lying just near the store cupboard and I \nbetween the table legs. The smell wasn’t quite so bad when \none was on the floor, but still Mrs. Van Daan quietly brought \nsome chlorine, a tea towel over the pot serving as a second \nexpedient. \n\nTalk, whispers, fear, stink, flatulation, and always someone \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n180 \n\n\non the pot; then try to go to sleep! However, by half past two \nI was so tired that I knew no more until half past three. I \nawoke when Mrs. Van Daan laid her head on my foot. \n\n“For heaven s sake, give me something to put on!” I asked. \nI was given something, but don’t ask what— a pair of woolen \nknickers over my pajamas, a red jumper, and a black skirt, \nwhite oversocks and a pair of sports stockings full of holes. \nThen Mrs. Van Daan sat in the chair and her husband came \nand lay on my feet. I lay thinking till half past three, shiver- \ning the whole time, which prevented Van Daan from sleeping. \nI prepared myself for the return of the police, then we’d have \nto say that we were in hiding; they would either be good \nDutch people, then we’d be saved, or N.S.B.-ers, 1 then we’d \nhave to bribe them! \n\n“In that case, destroy the radio,” sighed Mrs. Van Daan. \n“Yes, in the stove!” replied her husband. “If they find us, then \nlet them find the radio as well!” \n\n‘Then they will find Anne’s diary,” added Daddy. “Bum it \nthen,” suggested the most terrified member of the party. This, \nand when the police rattled the cupboard door, were my \nworst moments. “Not my diary; if my diary goes, I go with it!” \nBut luckily Daddy didn’t answer, \n\nThere is no object in recounting all the conversations that I \ncan still remember; so much was said. I comforted Mrs. Van \nDaan, who was very scared. We talked about escaping and \nbemg questioned by the Gestapo, about ringing up, and being \nbrave. \n\n“We must behave like soldiers, Mrs. Van Daan. If all is up \nnow, then let’s go for Queen and Country, for freedom, truth, \nand the right, as they always say on the Dutch News from \nEngland. The only thing that is really rotten is that we get a \nlot of other people into trouble too.” \n\nMr. Van Daan changed places again with his wife after an \nhour, and Daddy came and sat beside me. The men smoked \nnon-stop, now and then there was a deep sigh, then someone \nwent on the pot and everything began all over again. \n\nFour o’clock, five o’clock, half past five. Then I went and \n\nx The Dutch National Socialist Movement. \n\n\n\n181 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nsat with Peter by his window and listened, so close together \nthat we could feel each other’s bodies quivering; we spoke a \nword or two now and then, and listened attentively. In the \nroom next door they took down the blackout. They wanted to \ncall up Koophuis at seven o’clock and get him to send some- \none around. Then they wrote down everything they wanted to \ntell Koophuis over the phone. The risk that the police on \nguard at the door, or in the warehouse, might hear the tele- \nphone was very great, but the danger of the police returning \nwas even greater. \n\nThe points were these: \n\nBurglars broken in: police have been in the house, as far as \nthe swinging cupboard, but no further. \n\nBurglars apparently disturbed, forced open the door in the \nwarehouse and escaped through the garden. \n\nMain entrance bolted, Kraler must have used the second \ndoor when he left. The typewriters and adding machine are \nsafe in the black case in the private office. \n\nTry to warn Henk and fetch the key from EUi, then go and \nlook round the office— on the pretext of feeding the cat. \n\nEverything went according to plan. Koophuis was phoned, \nthe typewriters which we had upstairs were put in the case. \nThen we sat around the table again and waited for Henk or \nthe police. \n\nPeter had fallen asleep and Van Daan and I were lying on \nthe floor, when we heard loud footsteps downstairs. I got up \nquietly: “That’s Henk.” \n\n“No, no, it’s the police,” some of the others said. \n\nSomeone knocked at the door, Miep whistled. This was too \nmuch for Mrs. Van Daan, she turned as white as a sheet and \nsank limply into a chair; had the tension lasted one minute \nlonger she would have fainted. \n\nOur room was a perfect picture when Miep and Henk en- \ntered, the table alone would have been worth photographing! \nA copy of Cinema and Theater, covered with jam and a \nremedy for diarrhea, opened at a page of dancing girls, two \njam pots, two started loaves of bread, a mirror, comb, matches. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\nash, cigarettes, tobacco, ash tray, books, a pair of pants, a \ntorch, toilet paper, etc., etc., lay jumbled together in varie- \ngated splendor. \n\nOf course Henk and Miep were greeted with shouts and \ntears. Henk mended the hole in the door with some planks, \nand soon went off again to inform the police of the burglary. \nMiep had also found a letter under the warehouse door from \nthe night watchman Slagter, who had noticed the hole and \nwarned the police, whom he would also visit \n\nSo we had half an hour to tidy ourselves. I’ve never seen \nsuch a change take place in half an hour. Margot and I took \nthe bedclothes downstairs, went to the W.C., washed, and did \nour teeth and hair. After that I tidied the room a bit and went \nupstairs again. The table there was already cleared, so we ran \noff some water and made coffee and tea, boiled the milk, and \nlaid the table for lunch. Daddy and Peter emptied the potties \nand cleaned them with warm water and chlorine. \n\nAt eleven o’clock we sat round the table with Henk, who \nwas back by that time, and slowly things began to be more \nnormal and cozy again. Henk’s story was as follows: \n\nMr. Slagter was asleep, but his wife told Henk that her hus- \nband had found the hole in our door when he was doing his \ntour round the canals, and that he had called a policeman, \nwho had gone through the building with him. He would be \ncoming to see Kraler on Tuesday and would tell him more \nthen. At the police station they knew nothing of the burglary \nyet, but the policeman had made a note of it at once and \nwould come and look round on Tuesday. On the way back \nHenk happened to meet our greengrocer at the comer, and \ntold him that the house had been broken into. “I know that,” \nhe said quite coolly. “I was passing last evening with my wife \nand saw the hole in the door. My wife wanted to walk on, but \nI just had a look in with my torch; then the thieves cleared at \nonce. To be on the safe side, I didn’t ring up the police, as \nwith you I didn’t think it was the thing to do. I don’t know \nanything, but I guess a lot.” \n\nHenk thanked him and went on. The man obviously guesses \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF a YOUNG GIRL 183 \n\nthat we're here, because he always brings the potatoes during \nthe lunch hour. Such a nice man! \n\nIt was one by the time Henk had gone and we'd finished \ndoing the dishes. We all went for a sleep. I awoke at a quarter \nto three and saw that Mr. Dussel had already disappeared. \nQuite by chance, and with my sleepy eyes, I ran into Peter in \nlie bathroom; he had just come down. We arranged to meet \ndownstairs. \n\nI tidied myself and went down. “Do you still dare to go to \nthe front attic?” he asked. I nodded, fetched my pillow, and \nwe went up to the attic. It was glorious weather, and soon the \nsirens were wailing; we stayed where we were. Peter put his \narm around my shoulder, and I put mine around his and so \nwe remained, our arms around each other, quietly waiting un- \ntil Margot came to fetch us for coffee at four o'clock. \n\nWe finished our bread, drank lemonade and joked (we \nwere able to again), otherwise everything went normally. In \nthe evening I thanked Peter because he was the bravest of us \naff. \n\nNone of us has ever been in such danger as that night. God \ntruly protected us; just think of it— the police at our secret \ncupboard, the light on right in front of it, and still we re- \nmained undiscovered. \n\nIf the invasion comes, and bombs with it, then it is each \nman for himself, but in this case the fear was also for our good, \ninnocent protectors. “We are saved, go on saving us!” That is \nall we can say. \n\nThis affair has brought quite a number of changes with it. \nMr. Dussel no longer sits downstairs in Kraler’s office in the \nevenings, but in the bathroom instead. Peter goes round the \nhouse for a checkup at half past eight and half past nine. Peter \nisn't allowed to have his window open at nights any more. No \none is allowed to pull the plug after half past nine. This eve- \nning there's a carpenter coming to make the warehouse doors \neven stronger. \n\nNow there are debates going on all the time in the “Secret \nAnnexe.” Kraler reproached us for our carelessness. Henk, too, \nsaid that in a case like that we must never go downstairs. We \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n184 \n\n\nhave been pointedly reminded that we are in hiding, that we \nare Jews in chains, chained to one spot, without any rights, but \nwith a thousand duties. We Jews mustn't show our feelings, \nmust be brave and strong, must accept all inconveniences and \nnot gr um ble, must do what is within our power and trust in \nGod. Sometime this terrible war will be over. Surely the time \nwill come when we are people again, and not just Jews. \n\nWho has inflicted this upon us? Who has made us Jews dif- \nferent from all other people? Who has allowed us to suffer so \nterribly up till now? It is God that has made us as we are, but \nit will be God, too, who will raise us up again. If we bear all \nthis suffering and if there are still Jews left, when it is over, \nthen Jews, instead of being doomed, will be held up as an ex- \nample. Who knows, it might even be our religion from which \nthe world and all peoples learn good, and for that reason and \nthat reason only do we have to suffer now. We can never be- \ncome just Netherlander, or just English, or representatives \nof any country for that matter, we will always remain Jews, \nbut we want to, too. \n\nBe brave! Let us remain aware of our task and not grumble, \na solution will come, God has never deserted our people. Right \nthrough the ages there have been Jews, through all the ages \nthey have had to suffer, but it has made them strong too; the \nweak fall, but the strong will remain and never go under! \n\nDuring that night I really felt that I had to die, I waited for \nthe police, I was prepared, as the soldier is on the battlefield. \nI was eager to lay down my life for the country, but now, now \nIve been saved again, now my first wish after the war is that I \nmay become Dutch! I love the Dutch, I love this country, I \nlove the language and want to work here. And even if I have \nto write to the Queen myself, I will not give up until I have \nreached my goal. \n\nI am becoming still more independent of my parents, young \nas I am, I face life with more courage than Mummy; my feel- \ning for justice is immovable, and truer than hers. I know what \nI want, I have a goal, an opinion, I have a religion and love. \nLet me be myself and then I am satisfied. I know that I’m a \nwoman, a woman with inward strength and plenty of courage. \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n185 \n\n\nIf God lets me live, I shall attain more than Mummy ever \nhas done, I shall not remain insignificant, I shall work in the \nworld and for mankind! \n\nAnd now I know that first and foremost I shall require cour- \nage and cheerfulness! \n\nYours, Anne",

Mrs. Van Daan is in bed with a \ncold and trumpeting away. Mr. Van Daan grows pale without \nhis fags, Dussel, who is giving up a lot of his comfort, is full of \nobservations, etc., etc. \n\nThere is no doubt that our luck's not in at the moment. The \nlavatory leaks and the washer of the tap has gone, but, thanks \nto our many connections, we shall soon be able to get these \nthings put right. \n\nI am sentimental sometimes, I know that, but there is oc- \ncasion to be sentimental here at times, when Peter and I are \nsitting somewhere together on a hard, wooden crate in the \nmidst of masses of rubbish and dust, our arms around each \nother's shoulders, and very close, he with one of my curls in \nhis hand; when the birds sing outside and you see the trees \nchanging to green, the sun invites one to be out in the open \nair, when the sky is so blue, then— oh, then, I wish for so \nmuch! \n\nOne sees nothing but dissatisfied, grumpy faces here, noth- \ning but sighs and suppressed complaints; it really would seem \nas if suddenly we were very badly off here. If the truth is told, \nthings are just as bad as you yourself care to make them. \nThere's no one here that sets a good example; everyone should \nsee that he gets the better of his own moods. Every day you \nhear, \"If only it was all over.\" \n\nMy work, my hope, my love, my courage, all these things \nkeep my head above water and keep me from complaining. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n186 \n\n\nI really believe, Kits, that I'm slightly bats today, and yet I \ndon t know why. Everything here is so mixed up, nothings \nconnected any more, and sometimes I very much doubt \nwhether in the future anyone will be interested in all my tosh. \n\n“The unbosomings of an ugly duckling” will be the title of \nall this nonsense. My diary really wont be much use to Messrs. \nBolkestein or Gerbrandy . 1 \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Saturday, 15 April, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\n\"Shock upon shock. Will there ever be an end?” We hon- \nestly can ask ourselves that question now. Guess what's the \nlatest. Peter forgot to unbolt the front door (which is bolted \non the inside at night) and the lock of the other door doesn't \nwork. The result was that Kraler and the men could not get \ninto the house, so he went to the neighbors, forced open the \nkitchen window, and entered the building from the back. He \nis livid at us for being so stupid. \n\nI can tell you, it's upset Peter frightfully. At one meal, when \nM umm y said she felt more sorry for Peter than anyone else, \nhe almost started to cry. Were all just as much to blame as he \nis, because nearly every day the men ask whether the door’s \nbeen unbolted and, just today, no one did. \n\nPerhaps I shall be able to console him a bit later on; I \nwould so love to help him. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\nSunday morning, just before eleven o'clock, \n\n16 April, 1944 \n\n\nDarlingest Kitty, \n\nRemember yesterday's date, for it is a very important day \nin my life. Surely it is a great day for every girl when she re- \n\niTwo members of the wartime Dutch Cabinet-in-Exile in London. \n\n\n\n187 \n\n\nthe diary of a young girl \n\nceives her first kiss? Well, then, it is just as important for me \ntoo! Brains kiss on my right cheek doesn’t count any more, \nlikewise the one from Mr. Walker on my right hand. \n\nHow did I suddenly come by this kiss? Well, I will tell you. \n\nYesterday evening at eight o’clock I was sitting with Peter \non his divan, it wasn’t long before his arm went round me. \n“Let’s move up a bit,” I said, “then I don’t bump my head \nagainst the cupboard.” He moved up, almost into the comer, \nI laid my arm under his and across his back, and he just about \nburied me, because his arm was hanging on my shoulder. \n\nNow we’ve sat like this on other occasions, but never so \nclose together as yesterday. He held me firmly against him, \nmy left shoulder against his chest; already my heart began to \nbeat faster, but we had not finished yet. He didn’t rest until \nmy head was on his shoulder and his against it. When I sat \nupright again after about five minutes, he soon took my head \nin his hands and laid it against him once more. Oh, it was so \nlovely, I couldn’t talk much, the joy was too great. He stroked \nmy cheek and arm a bit awkwardly, played with my curls and \nour heads lay touching most of the time. I can’t tell you, Kitty, \nthe feeling that ran through me all the while. I was too happy \nfor words, and I believe he was as well. \n\nWe got up at half past eight. Peter put on his gym shoes, \nso that when he toured the house he wouldn’t make a noise, \nand I stood beside him. How it came about so suddenly, I \ndon’t know, but before we went downstairs he kissed me, \nthrough my hair, half on my left cheek, half on my ear; I tore \ndownstairs without looking round, and am simply longing for \ntoday! \n\nYours, Anne",

I don’t really think \nthey would, but I must rely on myself over this. It is so quiet \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n188 \n\n\nand peaceful to lie in his arms and to dream, it is so thrilling \nto feel his cheek against mine, it is so lovely to know that \nthere is someone waiting for me. But there is indeed a big \n“but,” because will Peter be content to leave it at this? I \nhaven t forgotten his promise already, but ... he is a boy! \n\nI know myself that I’m starting very soon, not even fifteen, \nand so independent already! It’s certainly hard for other \npeople to understand, I know almost for certain that Margot \nwould never kiss a boy unless there had been some talk of an \nengagement or marriage, but neither Peter nor I have any- \nthing like that in mind. I’m sure too that Mummy never \ntouched a man before Daddy. What would my girl friends \nsay about it if they knew that I lay in Peters arms, my heart \nagainst his chest, my head on his shoulder and with his head \nagainst mine! \n\nOh, Anne, how scandalous! But honestly, I don’t think it \nIs; we are shut up here, shut away from the world, in fear and \nanxiety, especially just lately. Why, then, should we who love \neach other remain apart? Why should we wait until we’ve \nreached a suitable age? Why should we bother? \n\nI have taken it upon myself to look after myself; he would \nnever want to cause me sorrow or pain. Why shouldn’t I \nfollow the way my heart leads me, if it makes us both happy? \nAll the same, Kitty, I believe you can sense that I’m in doubt, \nI think it must be my honesty which rebels against doing \nanything on the sly! Do you think it’s my duty to tell Daddy \nwhat I’m doing? Do you think we should share our secret with \na third person? A lot of the beauty would be lost, but would \nmy conscience feel happier? I will discuss it with “him.” \n\nOh, yes, there’s still so much I want to talk to him about, \nfor I don’t see the use of only just cuddling each other. To \nexchange our thoughts, that shows confidence and faith in \neach other, we would both be sure to profit by it! \n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n189",

I explained \neverything about girls to him and didn't hesitate to discuss \nthe most intimate things. The evening ended by each giving \nthe other a kiss, just about beside my mouth, it's really a lovely \nfeeling. \n\nPerhaps IH take my diary up there sometime, to go more \ndeeply into things for once. I don't get any satisfaction out \nof lying in each other's arms day in, day out, and would so \nlike to feel that he's the same. \n\nWe are having a superb spring after our long, lingering \nwinter; April is really glorious, not too hot and not too cold, \nwith little showers now and then. Our chestnut tree is al- \nready quite greenish and you can even see little blooms here \nand there. \n\nElli gave us a treat on Saturday, by bringing four bunches \nof flowers, three bunches of narcissus and one of grape hya- \ncinths, the latter being for me. \n\nI must do some algebra, Kitty-good-by. \n\nYours, Anne",

We have been \nasking ourselves what prince this beauty is going to marry, but \ncannot think of anyone suitable. Perhaps her sister, Princess \nMargaret Rose, can have Prince Baudouin of Belgium one \nday. \n\nHere we are haying one misfortune after another. Scarcely \nhad the outside doors been strengthened than the warehouse \nman appeared again. In all probability it was he who stole \nthe potato meal and wants to put the blame on to Elli’s \nshoulders. The whole “Secret Annexe” is understandably het \nup again. Elli is beside herself with anger. \n\nI want to send in to some paper or other to see if they will \ntake one of my stories, under a pseudonym, of course. \n\nTill next time, darling! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 27 April , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMrs. Van Daan was in such a bad mood this morning, \nnothing but complaints! First, there’s her cold, and she cant \nget any lozenges, and so much nose-blowing is unendurable. \nNext, it’s that the sun’s not shining, that the invasion doesn’t \ncome, that we can t look out of the windows, etc., etc. We all \nhad to laugh at her; and she was sporting enough to join in. \nAt the moment I’m reading The Emperor Charles V, written \nby a professor at Gottingen University; he worked at the book \nfor forty years. I read fifty pages in five days; it’s impossible \nto do more. The book has 598 pages, so now you can work \nout how long it will take me-and there is a second volume to \nfollow. But very interesting. \n\nWhat doesn’t a schoolgirl get to know in a single dayl Take \nme, for example. First, I translated a piece from Dutch into \nEnglish, about Nelson’s last battle. After that, I went through \nsome more of Peter the Great’s war against Norway (1700- \n1721), Charles XII, Augustus the Strong, Stanislavs Leczin- \nsky, Mazeppa, Von Gorz, Brandenburg, Pomerania and Den- \nmark, plus the usual dates. \n\nAfter that I landed up in Brazil, read about Bahia tobacco, \nthe abundance of coffee and the one and a half million in- \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n192 \n\n\nhabitants of Rio de Janeiro, of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, \nnot forgetting the river Amazon; about Negroes, Mulattos, \nMestizos, Whites, more than fifty per cent of the population \nbeing illiterate, and the malaria. As there was still some time \nleft, I quickly ran through a family tree. Jan the Elder, \nWillem Lodewijk, Ernst Casimir I, Hendrik Casimir I, right \nup to the little Margriet Franciska (bora in 1943 in Ottawa). \n\nTwelve o’clock: In the attic, I continued my program with \nthe history of the Church-Phew! Till one o’clock. \n\nJust after two, the poor child sat working (Tim, ’Em!) \nagain, this time studying narrow- and broad-nosed monkeys. \nKitty, tell me quickly how many toes a hippopotamus has! ! \nThen followed the Bible, Noah and the Ark, Shem, Ham, \nand Japheth. After that Charles V. Then with Peter: The \nColonel, in English by Thackeray. Heard my French verbs \nand then compared the Mississippi with the Missouri. \n\nI’ve still got a cold and have given it to Margot as well as \nto Mummy and Daddy. As long as Peter doesn’t get it! He \ncalled me his “Eldorado” and wanted a kiss. Of course, I \ncouldn’t! Funny boy! But still, he’s a darling. \n\nEnough for today, good-by! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Friday , 28 April , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI have never forgotten my dream about Peter Wessel (see \nbeginning of January). If I think of it, I can still feel his \ncheek against mine now, and recall that lovely feeling that \nmade everything good. \n\nSometimes I have had the same feeling here with Peter, but \nnever to such an extent, until yesterday, when we were, as \nusual, sitting on the divan, our arms around each other’s \nwaists. Then suddenly the ordinary Anne slipped away and \na second Anne took her place, a second Anne who is not reck- \nless and jocular, but one who just wants to love and be gentle. \n\nI sat pressed closely against him and felt a wave of emotion \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n193 \n\n\ncome over me, tears sprang into my eyes, the left one trickled \nonto his dungarees, the right one ran down my nose and also \nfell onto his dungarees. Did he notice? He made no move or \nsign to show that he did. I wonder if he feels the same as I \ndo? He hardly said a word. Does he know that he has two \nAnnes before him? These questions must remain unanswered. \n\nAt half past eight I stood up and went to the window, \nwhere we always say good-by. I was still trembling, I was still \nAnne number two. He came towards me, I flung my arms \naround his neck and gave him a kiss on his left cheek, and was \nabout to kiss the other cheek, when my lips met his and we \npressed them together. In a whirl we were clasped in each \nother s arms, again and again, never to leave off. Oh, Peter \ndoes so need tenderness. For the first time in his life he has \ndiscovered a girl, has seen for the first time that even the most \nirritating girls have another side to them, that they have \nhearts and can be different when you are alone with them. \nFor the first time in his life he has given of himself and, hav- \ning never had a boy or girl friend in his life before, shown his \nreal self. Now we have found each other. For that matter, I \ndidn’t know him either, like him having never had a trusted \nfriend, and this is what it has come to. . . . \n\nOnce more there is a question which gives me no peace: \"Is \nit right? Is it right that I should have yielded so soon, that I \nam so ardent, just as ardent and eager as Peter himself? May \nI, a girl, let myself go to this extent?” There is but one an- \nswer: \"I have longed so much and for so long-I am so lonely \n—and now I have found consolation.” \n\nIn the mornings we just behave in an ordinary way, in the \nafternoons more or less so (except just occasionally); but m \nthe evenings the suppressed longings of the whole day, the \nhappiness and the blissful memories of all the previous occa- \nsions come to the surface and we only think of each other. \nEvery evening, after the last kiss, I would like to dash away, \nnot to look into his eyes any more— away, away, alone in the \ndarkness. \n\nAnd what do I have to face, when I reach the bottom of \nthe staircase? Bright lights, questions, and laughter; I have to \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n194 \n\n\nswallow it all and not show a thing. My heart still feels too \nmuch; I can t get over a shock such as I received yesterday all \nat once. The Anne who is gentle shows herself too little any- \nway and, therefore, will not allow herself to be suddenly \ndriven into the background. Peter has touched my emotions \nmore deeply than anyone has ever done before— except in my \ndreams. Peter has taken possession of me and turned me in- \nside out; surely it goes without saying that anyone would re- \nquire a rest and a little while to recover from such an \nupheaval? \n\nOh Peter, what have you done to me? What do you want \nof me? Where will this lead us? Oh, now I understand Elli; \nnow, now that I am going through this myself, now I under- \nstand her doubt; if I were older and he should ask me to \nmarry him, what should I answer? Anne, be honest! You \nwould not be able to marry him, but yet, it would be hard to \nlet him go. Peter hasn’t enough character yet, not enough \nwill power, too little courage and strength. He is still a child \nin his heart of hearts, he is no older than I am; he is only \nsearching for tranquillity and happiness. \n\nAm I only fourteen? Am I really still a silly little school- \ngirl? Am I really so inexperienced about everything? I have \nmore experience than most, I have been through things that \nhardly anyone of my age has undergone. I am afraid of my- \nself, I am afraid that in my longing I am giving myself too \nquickly. How, later on, can it ever go right with other boys? \nOh, it is so difficult, always battling with one’s heart and \nreason; in its own time, each will speak, but do I know for \ncertain that I have chosen the right time? \n\nYours, Anne",

I \nwas glad, for it shows that he’s an honest boy. As soon as I \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n195 \n\n\ngot downstairs I went off with Daddy to get some water; \nand while we were on the stairs I said, \"Daddy, I expect \nyouve gathered that when were together Peter and I don’t \nsit miles apart. Do you think it’s wrong?” Daddy didn’t reply \nimmediately, then said, \"No, I don’t think it’s wrong, but you \nmust be careful, Anne, you’re in such a confined space here.” \nWhen we went upstairs, he said something else on the same \nlines. On Sunday morning he called me to him and said, \n\"Anne, I have thought more about what you said.” I felt \nscared already. \"It’s not really very right-here in this house; \nI thought that you were just pals. Is Peter in love?” \n\n“Oh, of course not,” I replied. \n\n“You know that I understand both of you, but you must \nbe the one to hold back. Don’t go upstairs so often, don’t \nencourage him more than you can help. It is the man who is \nalways the active one in these things; the woman can hold \nhim back. It is quite different under normal circumstances, \nwhen you are free, you see other boys and girls, you can get \naway sometimes, play games and do all kinds of other things; \nbut here, if you’re together a lot, and you want to get away, \nyou can’t; you see each other every hour of the day-in fact, \nall the time. Be careful, Anne, and don’t take it too seriously!” \n\n“I don’t, Daddy, but Peter is a decent boy, really a nice \nboy!” \n\n“Yes, but he is not a strong character; he can be easily in- \nfluenced, for good, but also for bad; I hope for his sake that \nhis good side will remain uppermost, because, by nature, that \nis how he is.” \n\nWe talked on for a bit and agreed that Daddy should talk \nto him too. \n\nOn Sunday morning in the attic he asked, “And have you \ntalked to your father, Anne?” \n\n“Yes,” I replied, “I’ll tell you about it. Daddy doesn’t think \nit’s bad, but he says that here, where were so close together \nall the time, clashes may easily arise.” \n\n“But we agreed, didn’t we, never to quarrel; and I’m de- \ntermined to stick to it!” \n\n“So will I, Peter, but Daddy didn’t think that it was like \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK 196 \n\nthis, he just thought we were pals; do you think that we still \ncan be?” \n\n\"I can— what about you?” \n\n\"Me too, I told Daddy that I trusted you. I do trust you, \nPeter, just as much as I trust Daddy, and I believe you to be \nworthy of it. You are, aren't you, Peter?” \n\n\"I hope so.” (He was very shy and rather red in the face.) \n\n\"I believe in you, Peter,” I went on, \"I believe that you \nhave good qualities, and that you 11 get on in the world.” \n\nAfter that, we talked about other things. Later I said, \"If \nwe come out of here, I know quite well that you won’t bother \nabout me any more!” \n\nHe flared right up. \"That’s not true, Anne, oh no, I won’t \nlet you think that of me!” \n\nThen I was called away. \n\nDaddy has talked to him; he told me about it today. ‘\"Your \nfather thought that the friendship might develop into love \nsooner or later,” he said. But I replied that we would keep a \ncheck on ourselves. \n\nDaddy doesn’t want me to go upstairs so much in the eve- \nnings now, but I don’t want that. Not only because I like be- \ning with Peter; I have told him that I trust him. I do trust \nhim and I want to show him that I do, which can’t happen if \nI stay downstairs through lack of trust. \n\nNo, I’m going! \n\nIn the meantime the Dussel drama has righted itself again. \nAt supper on Saturday evening he apologized in beautiful \nDutch. Van Daan was nice about it straight away; it must \nhave taken Dussel a whole day to learn that little lesson off \nby heart. \n\nSunday, his birthday, passed peacefully. We gave him a \nbottle of good 1919 wine, from the Van Daans (who could \ngive their presents now after all) , a bottle of piccalilli and a \npacket of razor blades, a jar of lemon jam from Kraler, a \nbook, Little Martin, from Miep, and a plant from Elli. He \ntreated each one of us to an egg. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n197",

        "original_text": "Wednesday , 3 May , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nFirst, just the news of the week. Were having a holiday \nfrom politics, there is nothing, absolutely nothing to an- \nnounce. I too am gradually beginning to believe that the in- \nvasion will come. After all, they can’t let the Russians clear \nup everything; for that matter, they’re not doing anything \neither at the moment. \n\nMr. Koophuis comes to the office every morning again now. \nHe’s got a new* spring for Peter’s divan, so Peter will have to \ndo some upholstering, about which, quite understandably, he \ndoesn’t feel a bit happy. \n\nHave I told you that Boche has disappeared? Simply van- \nished— we haven’t seen a sign of her since Thursday of last \nweek I expect she’s already in the cats’ heaven, while some \nanimal lover is enjoying a succulent meal from her. Perhaps \nsome little girl will be given a fur cap out of her skin. Peter \nis very sad about it. \n\nSince Saturday we’ve changed over, and have lunch at half \npast eleven m the mornings, so we have to last out with one \ncupful of porridge; this saves us a meal Vegetables are still \nvery difficult to obtain: we had rotten boiled lettuce this \nafternoon. Ordinary lettuce, spinach, and boiled lettuce, \nthere’s nothing else. With these we eat rotten potatoes, so it’s \na delicious combination! \n\nAs you can easily imagine we often ask ourselves here \ndespairingly: “What, oh, what is the use of the war? Why \ncan’t people live peacefully together? Why all this destruc- \ntion?” \n\nThe question is very understandable, but no one has found \na satisfactory answer to it so far. Yes, why do they make still \nmore gigantic planes, still heavier bombs and, at the same \ntime, prefabricated houses for reconstruction? Why should \nmillions be spent daily on the war and yet there’s not a penny \navailable for medical services, artists, or for poor people? \n\nWhy do some people have to starve, while there are sur- \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n198 \n\n\npluses rotting in other parts of the world? Oh, why are people \nso crazy? \n\nI don’t believe that the big men, the politicians and the \ncapitalists alone, are guilty of the war. Oh no, the little man is \njust as guilty, otherwise the peoples of the world would have \nrisen in revolt long ago! There’s in people simply an urge to \ndestroy, an urge to kill, to murder and rage, and until all man- \nkind, without exception, undergoes a great change, wars will \nbe waged, everything that has been built up, cultivated, and \ngrown will be destroyed and disfigured, after which mankind \nwill have to begin all over again. \n\nI have often been downcast, but never in despair; I regard \nour hiding as a dangerous adventure, romantic and interest- \ning at the same time. In my diary I treat all the privations as \namusing. I have made up my mind now to lead a different \nlife from other girls and, later on, different from ordinary \nhousewives. My start has been so very full of interest, and that \nis the sole reason why I have to laugh at the humorous side of \nthe most dangerous moments. \n\nI am young and I possess many buried qualities; I am young \nand strong and am living a great adventure; I am still in the \nmidst of it and can’t grumble the whole day long. I have been \ngiven a lot, a happy nature, a great deal of cheerfulness and \nstrength. Every day I feel that I am developing inwardly, that \nthe liberation is drawing nearer and how beautiful nature is, \nhow good the people are about me, how interesting this ad- \nventure is! Why, then, should I be in despair? \n\nYours, Anne",

He doesn’t want any \"necking,” a word I can’t bear. \nIt was bad enough talking about it, why must he make it so \nunpleasant now? I shall talk to him today. Margot has given \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n199 \n\n\nme some good advice, so listen; this is roughly what I want \nto say: \n\n“I believe, Daddy, that you expect a declaration from me, \nso I will give it you. You are disappointed in me, as you had \nexpected more reserve from me, and I suppose you want me to \nbe just as a fourteen-year-old should be. But that’s where \nyou re mistaken! \n\n“Since we’ve been here, from July 1942 until a few weeks \nago, I can assure you that I haven't had an easy time. If \nyou only knew how I cried in the evening, how unhappy I \nwas, how lonely I felt, then you would understand that I \nwant to go upstairs! \n\n“I have now reached the stage that I can live entirely on \nmy own, without Mummy’s support or anyone else’s for that \nmatter. But it hasn’t just happened in a night; it’s been a \nbitter, hard struggle and I’ve shed many a tear, before I be- \ncame as independent as I am now. You can laugh at me and \nnot believe me, but that can’t harm me. I know that I’m a \nseparate individual and I don’t feel in the least bit responsible \nto any of you. I am only telling you this because I thought \nthat otherwise you might think that I was underhand, but I \ndon’t have to give an account of my deeds to anyone but my- \nself. \n\n“When I was in difficulties you all closed your eyes and \nstopped up your ears and didn’t help me; on the contrary, I \nreceived nothing but warnings not to be so boisterous. I was \nonly boisterous so as not to be miserable all the time. I was \nreckless so as not Lo hear that persistent voice within me \ncontinually. I played a comedy for a year and a half, day in, \nday out, I never grumbled, never lost my cue, nothing like \nthat— and now, now the battle is over. I have won! I am in- \ndependent both in mind and body. I don’t need a mother any \nmore, for all this conflict has made me strong. \n\n“And now, now that I’m on top of it, now that I know \nthat I’ve fought the battle, now I want to be able to go on in \nmy own way too, the way that I think is right. You can’t and \nmustn’t regard me as fourteen, for all these troubles have \nmade me older; I shall not be sorry for what I have done, but \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n200 \n\n\nshall act as I think I can. You can’t coax me into not going \nupstairs; either you forbid it, or you trust me through thick \nand thin, but then leave me in peace as welll” \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Saturday, 6 May , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nI put a letter, in which I wrote what I explained to you \nyesterday, in Daddy’s pocket before supper yesterday. After \nreading it, he was, according to Margot, very upset for the \nrest of the evening. (I was upstairs doing the dishes.) Poor \nPirn, I might have known what the effect of such an epistle \nwould be. He is so sensitive! I immediately told Peter not to \nask or say anything more. Pirn hasn’t said any more about it \nto me. Is that yet in store, I wonder? \n\nHere everything is going on more or less normally again. \nWhat they tell us about the prices and the people outside is \nalmost unbelievable, half a pound of tea costs 350 florins, 1 a \npound of coffee 80 florins, butter 35 florins per pound, an \negg 1.45 florin. People pay 14 florins for an ounce of Bul- \ngarian tobacco! Everyone deals in the black market, every \nerrand boy has something to offer. Our baker’s boy got hold \nof some sewing silk, 0.9 florin for a thin little skein, the milk- \nman manages to get clandestine ration cards, the undertaker \ndelivers the cheese. Burglaries, murders, and theft go on \ndaily. The police and night watchmen jain in just as strenu- \nously as the professionals, everyone wants something in their \nempty stomachs and because wage increases are forbidden \nthe people simply have to swindle. The police are continually \non the go, tracing girls of fifteen, sixteen, seventeen and \nolder, who are reported missing every day. \n\nYours, Anne \n\n*A florin is equal to approximately twenty-eight cents. \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n201 \n\n\nSunday morning, 7 May, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nDaddy and I Rad a long talk yesterday afternoon, I cried \ntembly and Re joined in. Do yon know wRat Re said to me, \nKitty? “I Rave received many letters in my life, but tins is cer- \ntainly ffte most unpleasant! You, Anne, wRo Rave received \nsucR love from your parents, you, wRo Rave parents wRo are \nalways ready to Relp you, who Rave always defended you \nwRatever it migRt be, can you talk of feeling no responsi- \nbility towards us? You feel wronged and deserted; no, Anne, \nyou Rave done us a great injustice! \n\n“Perhaps you didn’t mean it like that, but it is what you \nwrote; no, Anne, we haven’t deserved such a reproach as \nthis!” \n\nOR, I Rave failed miserably; this is certainly the worst thing \nI’ve ever done in my life. I was only trying to show off with \nmy crying and my tears, just trying to appear big, so that Re \nwould respect me. Certainly, I Rave had a lot of unhappiness, \nbut to accuse the good Pirn, who has done and still does do \neverything for me~-no, that was too low for words. \n\nIt’s right that for once I’ve been taken down from my in- \naccessible pedestal, that my pride has been shaken a bit, for \nI was becoming much too taken up with myself again. What \nMiss Anne does is by no means always right! Anyone who can \ncause such unhappiness to someone else, someone Re pro- \nfesses to love, and on purpose, too, is low, very low! \n\nAnd the way Daddy has forgiven me makes me feel more \nthan ever ashamed of myself, Re is going to throw the letter \nin the fire and is so sweet to me now, just as if he had done \nsomething wrong. No, Anne, you still have a tremendous lot \nto learn, begin by doing that first, instead of looking down on \nothers and accusing them! \n\nI have Rad a lot of sorrow, but who hasn’t at my age? I \nRave played the clown a lot too, but I was hardly conscious \nof it; I felt lonely, but hardly ever in despair! I ought to be \ndeeply ashamed of myself, and indeed I am. \n\nWRat is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n202 \n\n\nhappening again. I want to start from the beginning again \nand it can't be difficult, now that I have Peter. With him to \nsupport me, I can and will! \n\nI’m not alone any more; he loves me. I love him, I have my \nbooks, my storybook and my diary, I’m not so frightfully ugly, \nnot utterly stupid, have a cheerful temperament and want to \nhave a good character! \n\nYes, Anne, you’ve felt deeply that your letter was too hard \nand that it was untrue. To think that you were even proud \nof it! I will take Daddy as my example, and I will improve. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Monday , 8 May , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nHave I ever really told you anything about our family? \n\nI don’t think I have, so I will begin now. My father’s \nparents were very rich. His father had worked himself right \nup and his mother came from a prominent family, who were \nalso rich. So in his youth Daddy had a real little rich boy’s \nupbringing, parties every week, balls, festivities, beautiful \ngirls, dinners, a large home, etc., etc. \n\nAfter Grandpa’s death all the money was lost during the \nWorld War and the inflation that followed. Daddy was \ntherefore extremely well brought up and he laughed very \nmuch yesterday when, for the first time in his fifty-five years, \nhe scraped out the frying pan at table. \n\nMummy’s parents were rich too and we often listen open- \nmouthed to stories of engagement parties of two hundred and \nfifty people, private balls and dinners. One certainly could \nnot call us rich now, but all my hopes are pinned on after the \nwar. \n\nI can assure you I’m not at all keen on a narrow, cramped \nexistence like Mummy and Margot I’d adore to go to Paris \nfor a year and London for a year to learn the languages and \nstudy the history of art. Compare that with Margot, who \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n203 \n\n\nwants to be a midwife in Palestinel I always long to see \nbeautiful dresses and interesting people, \n\nI want to see something of the world and do all kinds of \nexciting things. I’ve already told you this before. And a little \nmoney as well won't do any harm. \n\nMiep told us this morning about a party she went to, to \ncelebrate an engagement. Both the future bride and bride- \ngroom came from rich families and everything was very \ngrand. Miep made our mouths water telling us about the food \nthey had: vegetable soup with minced meat balls in it, cheese, \nrolls, hors d’oeuvre with eggs and roast beef, fancy cakes, \nwine and cigarettes, as much as you wanted of everything \n(black market). Miep had ten drinks— can that be the \nwoman who calls herself a teetotaler? If Miep had all those, \nI wonder however many her spouse managed to knock back? \nNaturally, everyone at the party was a bit tipsy. There were \ntwo policemen from the fighting squad, who tooks photos of \nthe engaged couple. It seems as if we are never far from \nMiep’s thoughts, because she took down the addresses of \nthese men at once, in case anything should happen at \nsome time or other, and good Dutchmen might come in \nuseful. \n\nShe made our mouths water. We, who get nothing but two \nspoonfuls of porridge for our breakfast and whose tummies \nwere so empty that they were positively rattling, we, who get \nnothing but half-cooked spinach (to preserve the vitamins) \nand rotten potatoes day after day, we, who get nothing but \nlettuce, cooked or raw, spinach and yet again spinach in our \nhollow stomachs. Perhaps we may yet grow to be as strong as \nPopeye, although I don't see much sign of it at presentl \n\nIf Miep had taken us to the party we shouldn't have left \nany rolls for the other guests. I can tell you, we positively \ndrew the words from Miep's lips, we gathered round her, as if \nwe’d never heard about delicious food or smart people in our \nlives before! \n\nAnd these are the granddaughters of a millionaire. The \nworld is a queer place! \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n204",

Shall I \ntell you briefly what I have got to do? Well, then, by to- \nmorrow I must finish reading the first part of Galileo Galilei, \nas it has to be returned to the library. I only started it yester- \nday, but I shall manage it. \n\nNext week I have got to read Palestine at the Crossroads \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n206 \n\n\nand the second part of Galilei. Next I finished reading the \nfirst part of the biography of The Emperor Charles V yester- \nday, and it’s essential that I work out all the diagrams and \nfamily trees that I have collected from it. After that I have \nthree pages of foreign words gathered from various books, \nwhich have all got to be recited, written down, and learned. \nNumber four is that my film stars are all mixed up together \nand are simply gasping to be tidied up; however, as such a \nclearance would take several days, and since Professor Anne, \nas she’s already said, is choked with work, the chaos will have \nto remain a chaos. \n\nNext Theseus, Oedipus, Peleus, Orpheus, Jason, and \nHercules are all awaiting their turn to be arranged, as their \ndifferent deeds lie crisscross in my mind like fancy threads in \na dress; it’s also high time Myron and Phidias had some treat- \nment, if they wish to remain at all coherent. Likewise it’s the \nsame with the seven and nine years’ war; I’m mixing every- \nthing up together at this rate. Yes, but what can one do with \nsuch a memory! Think how forgetful I shall be when I’m \neighty! \n\nOh, something else, the Bible; how long is it still going to \ntake before I meet the bathing Susanna? And what do they \nmean by the guilt of Sodom and Gomorrah? Oh, there is still \nsuch a terrible lot to find out and to learn. And in the mean- \ntime I’ve left Lisolette of the Pfalz completely in the lurch. \n\nKitty, can you see that I’m just about bursting? \n\nNow, about something else: you’ve known for a long time \nthat my greatest wish is to become a journalist someday and \nlater on a famous writer. Whether these leanings towards \ngreatness (or insanity?) will ever materialize remains to be \nseen, but I certainly have the subjects in my mind. In any \ncase, I want to publish a book entitled Het Achterhuis after \nthe war. Whether I shall succeed or not, I cannot say, but \nmy diary will be a great help. I have other ideas as well, be- \nsides Het Achterhuis. But I will write more fully about them \nsome other time, when they have taken a clearer form in my \nmind. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n207",

The invasion was to have \ncome last year, and the Firms were to have been out of the \nwar by now. Italy was finished in the winter, but the Russians \nwould already have Lemberg; oh, no, I don’t think much of \nyour prophecies.” \n\nMr. Van Daan (standing up): “It’s about time you shut \nyour mouth. One day I’ll show you that I’m right; sooner or \nlater you’ll get enough of it. I can’t bear any more of your \ngrousing. You’re so infuriating but you’ll stew in your own \njuice one day.” \n\nEnd of Part I. \n\nI really couldn’t help laughing. Mummy too, while Peter \nsat biting his lip.

My whole portfolio of family trees, writing \nbooks, textbooks, everything was soaked. I nearly wept and \nwas so worked up that I can hardly remember what I said, \nbut Margot said that I let fly something about “incalculable \nloss, frightful, terrible, can never be repaired,” and still more. \nDaddy burst out laughing, Mummy and Margot joined in, \nbut I could have cried over all the toil that was wasted, and \nthe diagrams I’d so carefully worked out. \n\nOn closer inspection the “incalculable loss” didn’t turn out \nto be as bad as I’d thought. I carefully sorted out all the \npapers that were stuck together and separated them in the \nattic. After that I hung them all up on the clothes lines to \n■dry. It was a funny sight and I couldn’t help laughing myself. \nMaria de Medici beside Charles V, William of Orange and \nMarie Antoinette; it’s a “racial outrage,” was Mr. Van \nDaan’s joke on the subject. After I’d entrusted my papers into \nPeter’s care I went downstairs again. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n2X0 \n\n\n\"‘Which books are spoiled?” I asked Margot, who was \nchecking up on them. “Algebra,” she said. I hurried to her \nside, but unfortunately not even the algebra book was spoiled. \nI wish it had fallen right in the vase; I’ve never loathed any \nother book so much as that one. There are the names of at \nleast twenty girls in the front, all previous owners; it is old, \nyellow, full of scribbles and improvements. If I’m ever in \na really very wicked mood, I’ll tear the blasted thing to \npieces! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Monday , 22 May, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nOn May 20th Daddy lost five bottles of yoghourt on a bet \nwith Mrs. Van Daan. The invasion still hasn’t come yet; it’s \nno exaggeration to say that all Amsterdam, all Holland, yes, \nthe whole west coast of Europe, right down to Spain, talks \nabout the invasion day and night, debates about it, and \nmakes bets on it and . . . hopes. \n\nThe suspense is rising to a climax. By no means everyone \nwe had regarded as “good” Dutch have stuck to their faith \nin the English; by no means everyone thinks the English bluff \na masterly piece of strategy, oh no, the people want to see \ndeeds at last, great, heroic deeds. Nobody sees beyond his \nown nose, no one thinks that the English are fighting for their \nown land and their own people, everyone thinks that it’s their \nduty to save Holland, as quickly and as well as they can. \n\nWhat obligations have the English towards us? How have \nthe Dutch earned the generous help that they seem so ex- \nplicitly to expect? Oh no, the Dutch will have made a big \nmistake, the English, in spite of all their bluff, are certainly \nno more to blame than all the other countries, great and \nsmall, which are not under occupation. The English really \nwon’t offer us their apologies, for even if we do reproach \nthem for being asleep during the years when Germany was re- \narming, we cannot deny that all the other countries, especially \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n211 \n\n\nthose bordering Germany, also slept. We shan’t get anywhere \nby following an ostrich policy. England and the whole world \nhave seen that only too well now, and that is why, one by \none, England, no less than the rest, will have to make heavy \nsacrifices. \n\nNo country is going to sacrifice its men for nothing and \ncertainly not in the interests of another. England is not going \nto do that either. The invasion, with liberation and freedom, \nwill come sometime, but England and America will appoint \nthe day, not all the occupied countries put together. \n\nTo our great horror and regret we hear that the attitude \nof a great many people towards us Jews has changed. We \nhear that there is anti-Semitism now in circles that never \nthought of it before. This news has affected us all very, very \ndeeply. The cause of this hatred of the Jews is understand- \nable, even human sometimes, but not good. The Christians \nblame the Jews for giving secrets away to the Germans, for \nbetraying their helpers and for the fact that, through the Jews \na great many Christians have gone the way of so many others \nbefore them, and suffered terrible punishments and a dread- \nful fate. \n\nThis is all true, but one must always look at these things \nfrom both sides. Would Christians behave differently in \nour place? The Germans have a means of making people \ntalk. Can a person, entirely at their mercy, whether Jew or \nChristian, always remain silent? Everyone knows that is prac- \ntically impossible. Why, then, should people demand the \nimpossible of the Jews? \n\nIt’s being murmured in underground circles that the Ger- \nman Jews who emigrated to Holland and who are now in \nPoland may not be allowed to return here; they once had \nthe right of asylum in Holland, but when Hitler has gone \nthey will have to go back to Germany again. \n\nWhen one hears this one naturally wonders why we are \ncarrying on with this long and difficult war. We always hear \nthat were all fighting together for freedom, truth, and right! \nIs discord going to show itself while we are still fighting, is \nthe Jew once again worth less than another? Oh, it is sad, \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n212 \n\n\nvery sad, that once more, for the umpteenth time, the old \ntruth is confirmed: “What one Christian does is his own \nresponsibility, what one Jew does is thrown back at all \nJews.” \n\nQuite honestly, I can't understand that the Dutch, who \nare such a good, honest, upright people, should judge us like \nthis, we, the most oppressed, the unhappiest, perhaps the \nmost pitiful of all peoples of the whole world. \n\nI hope one thing only, and that is that this hatred of the \nJews will be a passing thing, that the Dutch will show what \nthey are after all, and that they will never totter and lose \ntheir sense of right. For anti-Semitism is unjust! \n\nAnd if this terrible threat should actually come true, then \nthe pitiful little collection of Jews that remain will have to \nleave Holland. We, too, shall have to move on again with \nour little bundles, and leave this beautiful country, which \noffered us such a warm welcome and which now turns its \nback on us. \n\nI love Holland. I who, having no native country, had hoped \nthat it might become my fatherland, and I still hope it \nwill! \n\nYours, Anne",

The girls can’t and aren’t \nallowed to haul along our share of potatoes, so the only \nthing to do is to eat less. I will tell you how we shall do that; \nit’s certainly not going to make things any pleasanter. \nMummy says we shall cut out breakfast altogether, have \nporridge and bread for lunch, and for supper fried potatoes \nand possibly once or twice per week vegetables or lettuce, \nnothing more. Were going to be hungry, but anything is \nbetter than being discovered. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Friday , 26 May, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nAt last, at last I can sit quietly at my table in front of a \ncrack of window and write you everything. \n\nI feel so miserable, I haven’t felt like this for months; even \nafter the burglary I didn’t feel so utterly broken. On the \none hand, the vegetable man, the Jewish question, which \nis being discussed minutely over the whole house, the inva- \nsion delay, the bad food, the strain, the miserable atmos- \nphere, my disappointment in Peter; and on the other hand, \nElli’s engagement, Whitsun reception, flowers, Kraler’s \nbirthday, fancy cakes, and stories about cabarets, films, and \nconcerts. That difference, that huge difference, it’s always \nthere; one day we laugh and see the funny side of the situa- \ntion, but the next we are afraid, fear, suspense, and despair \nstaring from our faces. Miep and Kraler carry the heaviest \n[burden of the eight in hiding, Miep in all she does, and \nKraler through the enormous responsibility, which is some- \ntimes so much for him that he can hardly talk from pent-up \nnerves and strain. Koophuis and Elli look after us well too, \nbut they can forget us at times, even if it’s only for a few \nhours, or a day, or even two days. They have their own wor- \nries, Koophuis over his health, Elli over her engagement, \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n214 \n\n\nwhich is not altogether rosy, but they also have their little out- \nings, visits to friends, and the whole life of ordinary people. \nFor them the suspense is sometimes lifted, even if it is only for \na short time, but for us it never lifts for a moment. We’ve been \nhere for two years now; how long have we still to put up with \nthis almost unbearable, ever increasing pressure? \n\nThe sewer is blocked, so we mustn’t run water, or rather \nonly a trickle; when we go to the W.C. we have to take a lava- \ntory brush with us, and we keep dirty water in a large Cologne \npot. We can manage for today, but what do we do if the \nplumber can’t do the job alone? The municipal scavenging \nservice doesn’t come until Tuesday, \n\nMiep sent us a currant cake, made up in the shape of a doll, \nwith the words “Happy Whitsun” on the note attached to it. \nIt’s almost as if she’s ridiculing us; our present frame of mind \nand our uneasiness could hardly be called “happy.” The affair \nof the vegetable man has made us more nervous, you hear \n“shh, shh” from all sides again, and we re being quieter over \neverything. The police forced the door there, so they could do \nit to us tool If one day we too should ... no, I mustn’t write \nit, but I can’t put the question out of my mind today. On the \ncontrary, all the fear I’ve already been through seems to face \nme again in all its frightfulness. \n\nThis evening at eight o’clock I had to go to the downstairs \nlavatory all alone; there was no one down there, as everyone \nwas listening to the radio; I wanted to be brave, but it was \ndifficult. I always feel much safer here upstairs than alone \ndownstairs in that large, silent house; alone with the mysteri- \nous muffled noises from upstairs and the tooting of motor \nhorns in the street. I have to hurry for I start to quiver if I be- \ngin thinking about the situation. \n\nAgain and again I ask myself, would it not have been better \nfor us all if we had not gone into hiding, and if we were dead \nnow and not going through all this misery, especially as we \nshouldn’t be running our protectors into danger any more. But \nwe all recoil from these thoughts too, for we still love life; we \nhaven’t yet forgotten the voice of nature, we still hope, hope \nabout everything. I hope something will happen soon now, \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n215 \n\n\nshooting if need be^nothing can crush us more than this rest- \nlessness. Let the end come, even if it is hard; then at least we \nshall know whether we axe finally going to win through or go \nunder. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Wednesday, SI May, 1944 \n\nDear Kitty, \n\nIt was so frightfully hot on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and \nTuesday that I simply couldn’t hold a fountain pen in my \nhand. That’s why it was impossible to write to you. The drains \nwent phut again on Friday, were mended again on Saturday; \nMr. Koophuis came to see us in the afternoon and told us \nmasses about Corry and her being in the same hockey club as \nJopie. \n\nOn Sunday Elli came to make sure no one had broken in \nand stayed for breakfast, on Whit Monday Mr. Van Santen \nacted as the hide-out watchman, and, finally, on Tuesday the \nwindows could be opened again at last. \n\nThere’s seldom been such a beautiful, warm, one can even \nsay hot, Whitsun. The heat here in the “Secret Annexe” is ter- \nrible; I will briefly describe these warm days by giving you a \nsample of the sort of complaints that arise: \n\nSaturday: “Lovely, what perfect weather,” we all said in \nthe morning. “If only it wasn’t quite so warm,” in the after- \nnoon when the windows had to be closed. \n\nSunday: “It’s positively unbearable, this heat. The butter’s \nmelting, there’s not a cool spot anywhere in the house, the \nbread’s getting so dry, the milk’s going sour, windows can’t \nbe opened, and we, wretched outcasts, sit here suffocating \nwhile other people enjoy their Whitsun holiday.” \n\nMonday: “My feet hurt me, I haven’t got any thin clothes. \nI can’t wash the dishes in this heat,” all this from Mrs. Van \nDaan. It was extremely unpleasant. \n\nI still can’t put up with heat and am glad that there’ s a stiff \nbreeze today, and yet the sun still shines. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n216",

        "original_text": "Tuesday , 6 June , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\n\"This is D-day,” came the announcement over the English \nnews and quite rightly, \"this is the day/ 51 The invasion has \nbegun! \n\nThe English gave the news at eight o’clock this morning: \nCalais, Boulogne, Le Havre, and Cherbourg, also the Pas de \nCalais (as usual), were heavily bombarded. Moreover, as a \nsafety measure for all occupied territories, all people who live \nwithin a radius of thirty-five kilometers from the coast axe \nwarned to be prepared for bombardments. If possible, the \nEnglish will drop pamphlets one hour beforehand. \n\nAccording to German news, English parachute troops have \nlanded on the French coast, English landing craft are in battle \nwith the German Navy, says the B.B.C. \n\nWe discussed it over the “Annexe” breakfast at nine o’clock: \nIs this just a trial landing like Dieppe two years ago? \n\nEnglish broadcast in German, Dutch, French, and other \nlanguages at ten o’clock: “The invasion has begun!”~that \nmeans the “real” invasion. English broadcast in German at \neleven o’clock, speech by the Supreme Commander, General \nDwight Eisenhower. \n\n1 Ongmal English. \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n217 \n\n\nThe English news at twelve o’clock in English; “This is \nD-day.” General Eisenhower said to the French people: “Stiff \nfighting will come now, but after this the victory. The year \n1944 is the year of complete victory; good luck.” 1 \n\nEnglish news in English at one o’clock (translated) ; 11,000 \nplanes stand ready, and are flying to and fro non-stop, land- \ning troops and attacking behind the lines; 4000 landing boats, \nplus small craft, are landing troops and materiel between \nCherbourg and Le Havre incessantly. English and Am erican \ntroops are already engaged in hard fighting. Speeches by Ger- \nbrandy, by the Prime Minister of Belgium, King Haakon of \nNorway, De Gaulle of France, the King of England, and last, \nbut not least, Churchill. \n\nGreat commotion in the “Secret Annexe”! Would the long- \nawaited liberation that has been talked of so much, but which \nstill seems too wonderful, too much like a fairy tale, ever come \ntrue? Could we be granted victory this year, 1944? We don’t \nknow yet, but hope is revived within us; it gives us fresh cour- \nage, and makes us strong again. Since we must put up bravely \nwith all the fears, privations, and sufferings, the great thing \nnow is to remain calm and steadfast. Now more than ever we \nmust clench our teeth and not cry out. France, Russia, Italy, \nand Germany, too, can all cry out and give vent to their \nmisery, but we haven’t the right to do that yet! \n\nOh, Kitty, the best part of the invasion is that I have the \nfeeling that friends are approaching. We have been oppressed \nby those terrible Germans for so long, they have had their \nknives so at our throats, that the thoughts of friends and de- \nlivery fills us with confidence! \n\nNow it doesn’t concern the Jews any more; no, it concerns \nHolland and all occupied Europe. Perhaps, Margot says, I \nmay yet be able to go back to school in September or October. \n\nYours, Anne \n\nP.S. I’ll keep you up to date with all the latest newsl \n\n\nAnginal English. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n218",

        "original_text": "Friday, 9 June , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nSuper news of the invasion. The Allies have taken Bayeux, \na small village on the French coast, and are now fighting for \nCaen. It’s obvious that they intend to cut off the peninsular \nwhere Cherbourg lies. Every evening war correspondents give \nnews from the battle front, telling us of the difficulties, cour- \nage, and enthusiasm of the army; they manage to get hold of \nthe most incredible stories. Also some of the wounded who \nare already back in England again came to the microphone. \nThe air force are up all the time in spite of the miserable \nweather. We heard over the B.B.C. that Churchill wanted to \nland with the troops on D-day, however, Eisenhower and the \nother generals managed to get him out of the idea. Just think \nof it, what pluck he has for such an old man-he must be \nseventy at least. \n\nThe excitement here has worn off a bit; still, we re hoping \nthat the war will be over at the end of this year. It’ll be about \ntime too! Mrs. Van Daan’s grizzling is absolutely unbearable; \nnow she can’t any longer drive us crazy over the invasion, she \nnags us the whole day long about the bad weather. It really \nwould be nice to dump her in a bucket of cold water and put \nher up in the loft. \n\nThe whole of the “Secret Annexe” except Van Daan and \nPeter have read the trilogy Hungarian Rhapsody. This book \ndeals with the life history of the composer, virtuoso, and child \nprodigy, Franz Liszt. It is a very interesting book, but in my \nopinion there is a bit too much about women in it. In his time \nLiszt was not only the greatest and most famous pianist, but \nalso the greatest ladies’ man-right up to the age of seventy. \nHe lived with the Duchess Marie d’Agould, Princess Caroline \nSayn-Wittgenstein, the dancer Lola Montez, the pianist Agnes \nKingworth, the pianist Sophie Menter, Princess Olga Janina, \nBaroness Olga Meyendorff, the actress Lilia what’s-her-name, \netc., etc.; it is just endless.

        "original_text": "Wednesday , 14 June, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nMy head is haunted by so many wishes and thoughts, accu- \nsations and reproaches. I’m really not as conceited as so many \npeople seem to think, I know my own faults and shortcomings \nbetter than anyone, but the difference is that I also know that \nI want to improve, shall improve, and have already improved \na great deal. \n\nWhy is it then, I so often ask myself, that everyone still \nthinks I’m so terribly knowing and forward? Am I so knowing? \nIs it that I really am, or that maybe the others aren’t? That \nsounds queer, I realize now, but I shan’t cross out the last sen- \ntence, because it really isn’t so crazy. Everyone knows that \nMrs. Van Daan, one of my chief accusers, is unintelligent. I \nmight as well put it plainly and say \"stupid.” Stupid people \nusually can’t take it if others do better than they do. \n\nMrs. Van Daan thinks I’m stupid because I’m not quite so \nlacking in intelligence as she is; she thinks I’m forward be- \ncause she’s even more so; she thinks my dresses are too short, \nbecause hers are even shorter. And that’s also the reason that \nshe thinks I’m knowing, because she’s twice as bad about join- \ning in over subjects she knows absolutely nothing about. But \none of my favorite sayings is \"There’s no smoke without fire,” \nand I readily admit that I’m knowing. \n\nNow the trying part about me is that I criticize and scold \nmyself far more than anyone else does. Then if Mummy adds \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n221 \n\n\nher bit of advice the pile of sermons becomes so insurmount- \nable that in my despair I become rude and start contradicting \nand then, of course, the old well-known Anne watchword \ncomes back: “No one understands me!” This phrase sticks in \nmy mind; I know it sounds silly, yet there is some truth in it. I \noften accuse myself to such an extent that I simply long for a \nword of comfort, for someone who could give me sound ad- \nvice and also draw out some of my real self; but, alas, I keep \non looking, but I haven't found anyone yet. \n\nI know that you'll immediately think of Peter, won’t you, \nKit? It's like this: Peter loves me not as a lover but as a friend \nand grows more affectionate every day. But what is the mys- \nterious something that holds us both back? I don't understand \nit myself. Sometimes I think that my terrible longing for him \nwas exaggerated, yet that's really not it, because if I don't go \nup to see him for two days, then I long for him more desper- \nately than ever before. Peter is good and he's a darling, but \nstill there's no denying that there’s a lot about him that disap- \npoints me. Especially his dislike of religion and all his talk \nabout food and various other things don't appeal to me. Yet I \nfeel quite convinced that we shall never quarrel now that \nwe've made that straightforward agreement together. Pete is a \npeace-loving person; he’s tolerant and gives in very easily. He \nlets me say a lot of things to him that he would never accept \nfrom his mother, he tries most persistently to keep his things \nin order. And yet why should he keep his innermost self to \nhimself and why am I never allowed there? By nature he is \nmore closed-up than I am, I agree, but I know-and from my \nown experience-that at some time or other even the most un- \ncommunicative people long just as much, if not more, to find \nsomeone in whom they can confide. \n\nBoth Peter and I have spent our most meditative years in \nthe “Secret Annexe.” We often discuss the future, the past, \nand the present, but, as I've already said, I still seem to miss \nthe real thing and yet I know that it's there. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK",

I can perfectly well remember that there \nwas a time when a deep blue sky, the song of the birds, moon- \nlight and flowers could never have kept me spellbound. Thats \nchanged since I’ve been here. \n\nAt Whitsun, for instance, when it was so warm, I stayed \nawake on purpose until half past eleven one evening in order \nto have a good look at the moon for once by myself. Alas, the \nsacrifice was all in vain, as the moon gave far too much light \nand I didn’t dare risk opening a window. Another time, some \nmonths ago now, I happened to be upstairs one evening when \nthe window was open. I didn’t go downstairs until the window \nhad to be shut. The dark, rainy evening, the gale, the scud- \nding clouds held me entirely in their power; it was the first \ntime in a year and a half that I’d seen the night face to face. \nAfter that evening my longing to see it again was greater than \nmy fear of burglars, rats, and raids on the house. I went down- \nstairs all by myself and looked outside through the windows \nin the kitchen and the private office. A lot of people are fond \nof nature, many sleep outdoors occasionally, and people in \nprisons and hospitals long for the day when they will be free \nto enjoy the beauties of nature, but few are so shut away and \nisolated from that which can be shared alike by rich and poor. \nIt’s not imagination on my part when I say that to look up at \nthe sky, the clouds, the moon, and the stars makes me calm \nand patient. It’s a better medicine than either Valerian or \nbromine, Mother Nature makes me humble and prepared to \nface every blow courageously. \n\nAlas, it has had to be that I am only able— except on a few \nrare occasions-to look at nature through dirty net curtains \nhanging before very dusty windows. And it’s no pleasure look- \ning through these any longer, because nature is just the one \nthing that really must be unadulterated. \n\n\nYours, Anne \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\nm",

She’s \njealous that Peter confides in me and not her. She’s offended \nthat Dussel doesn’t enter into her flirtations with him, as she’d \nhoped, afraid that her husband is smoking all the fur-coat \nmoney away, she quarrels, uses abusive language, cries, pities \nherself, laughs, and then starts a fresh quarrel again. What on \nearth can one do with such a foolish, blubbering specimen? \nNo one takes her seriously, she hasn’t any character, and she \ngrumbles to everyone. The worst of it is that it makes Peter \nrude, Mr. Van Daan irritable, and Mummy cynical. Yes, it’s a \nfrightful situation! There’s one golden rale to keep before \nyou: laugh about everything and don’t bother yourself about \nthe others! It sounds selfish, but it’s honestly the only cure for \nanyone who has to seek consolation in himself. \n\nKraler has received another call-up to go digging for four \nweeks. He’s trying to get out of it with a doctor’s certificate \nand a letter from the business. Koophuis wants to have an \noperation on his stomach. All private telephones were cut off \nat eleven o’clock yesterday. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Thursday , 6 July, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nIt strikes fear to my heart when Peter talks of later being a \ncriminal, or of gambling; although it’s meant as a joke, of \ncourse, it gives me the feeling that he’s afraid of his own \nweakness. Again and again I hear from both Margot and \nPeter: “Yes, if I was as strong and plucky as you are, if I al- \nways stuck to what I wanted, if I had such persistent energy, \nyes then ... 1” \n\nI wonder if it’s really a good quality not to let myself be in- \nfluenced. Is it really good to follow almost entirely my own \nconscience? \n\nQuite honestly, I can’t imagine how anyone can say: “I’m \nweak,” and then remain so. After all, if you know it, why not \nfight against it, why not try to train your character? The an- \nswer was: “Because it’s so much easier not to!” This reply \nrather discouraged me. Easy? Does that mean that a lazy, \ndeceitful life is an easy life? Oh, no, that can’t be true, it \nmustn’t be true, people can so easily be tempted by slackness \n. . . and by money. \n\nI thought for a long time about the best answer to give \nPeter, how to get him to believe m himself and, above all, to \ntry and improve himself; I don’t know whether my line of \nthought is right though, or not. \n\nI’ve so often thought how lovely it would be to have some- \none’s complete confidence, but now, now that I’m that far, I \nrealize how difficult it is to think what the other person is \nthinking and then to find the right answer. More especially \nbecause the very ideas of “easy” and “money” are something \nentirely foreign and new to me. Peter’s beginning to lean on \nme a bit and that mustn’t happen under any circumstances. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n226 \n\n\nA type like Peter finds it difficult to stand on his own feet, but \nit's even harder to stand on your own feet as a conscious, liv- \ning being. Because if you do, then if s twice as difficult to steer \na right path through the sea of problems and still remain con- \nstant through it all. I’m just drifting around, have been search- \ning for days, searching for a good argument against that ter- \nrible word “easy,” something to settle it once and for all. \n\nHow can I make it clear to him that what appears easy and \nattractive will drag him down into the depths, depths where \nthere is no comfort to be found, no friends and no beauty, \ndepths from which it is almost impossible to raise oneself? \n\nWe all live, but we don’t know the why or the wherefore. \nWe all hve with the object of being happy; our lives are all \ndifferent and yet the same. We three have been brought up in \ngood circles, we have the chance to learn, the possibility of \nattaining something, we have all reason to hope for much hap- \npiness, but ... we must earn it for ourselves. And that is never \neasy. You must work and do good, not be lazy and gamble, if \nyou wish to earn happiness. Laziness may appear attractive, \nbut work gives satisfaction. \n\nI can’t understand people who don’t like work, yet that isn’t \nthe case with Peter; he just hasn’t got a fixed goal to aim at, \nand he thinks he’s too stupid and too inferior to achieve any- \nthing. Poor boy, he’s never known what it feels like to make \nother people happy, and I can’t teach him that either. He has \nno religion, scoffs at Jesus Christ, and swears, using the name \nof God; although I’m not orthodox either, it hurts me every \ntime I see how deserted, how scornful, and how poor he really \nis. \n\nPeople who have a religion should be glad, for not everyone \nhas the gift of believing in heavenly things. You don’t neces- \nsarily even have to be afraid of punishment after death; \npurgatory, hell, and heaven are things that a lot of people \ncan’t accept, but still a religion, it doesn’t matter which, keeps \na person on the right path. It isn’t the fear of God but the up- \nholding of one’s own honor and conscience. How noble and \ngood everyone could be if, every evening before falling asleep, \nthey were to recall to their minds the events of the whole day \n\n\n\n227 \n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nand consider exactly what has been good and bad. Then, with- \nout realizing it, you try to improve yourself at the start of each \nnew day; of course, you achieve quite a lot in the course of \ntime. Anyone can do this, it costs nothing and is certainly very \nhelpful. Whoever doesn't know it must learn and find by ex- \nperience that: \"A quiet conscience makes one strong!” \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Saturday , 8 July , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nThe chief representative of the business, Mr. B., has been \nin Beverwijk and managed, just like that, to get strawberries \nat the auction sale . 1 They arrived here dusty, covered with \nsand, but in large quantities. No less then twenty-four trays \nfor the office people and us. That very same evening we bot- \ntled six jars and made eight pots of jam. The next morning \nMiep wanted to make jam for the office people. \n\nAt half past twelve, no strangers in the house, front door \nbolted, trays fetched, Peter, Daddy, Van Daan clattering on \nthe stairs: Anne, get hot water; Margot, bring a bucket; all \nhands on deck! I went into the kitchen, which was chock-full, \nwith a queer feeling in my tummy, Miep, Elli, Koophuis, \nHenk, Daddy, Peter: the famihes in hiding and their supply \ncolumn, all mingling together, and in the middle of the day \ntoo! \n\nPeople can't see in from outside because of the net curtains, \nbut, even so, the loud voices and banging doors positively \ngave me the jitters. Are we really supposed to be m hiding? \nThat's what flashed through my mind, and it gives me a very \nqueer feeling to be able to appear in the world again. The \npan was full, and I dashed upstairs again. The rest of the fam- \nily was seated round our table in the kitchen busy stalk-pick- \ning-at least that's what they were supposed to be doing; more \nwent into mouths than into buckets. Another bucket would \n\n*It is compulsory in Holland for all growers to sell their produce at public \nauction. \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n228 \n\n\nsoon be required. Peter went to the downstairs kitchen again- \nthe bell rang twice; the bucket stayed where it was, Peter tore \nupstairs, locked the cupboard door! We were kicking our heels \nimpatiently, couldn't turn on a tap, even though the straw- \nberries were only half washed; the rule: \"If anyone m the \nhouse, use no water, because of the noise,\" was strictly main- \ntained. \n\nAt one o'clock Henk came and told us that it was the post- \nman. Peter hurried downstairs again. Ting-a-ling ... the bell, \nright about turn. I go and listen to see if I can hear anyone \ncoming, first at our cupboard door and then creep to the top \nof the stairs. Finally Peter and I both lean over the banisters \nlike a couple of thieves, listening to the din downstairs. No \nstrange voices, Peter sneaks down, stops halfway, and calls \nout: \"Elli!\" No answer, one more: \"Elli!” Peter's voice is \ndrowned by the din in the kitchen. He goes right down and \ninto the kitchen. I stand looking down tensely. \"Get upstairs at \nonce, Peter, the accountant is here, clear out!\" It was Koop- \nhuis speaking. Peter comes upstairs sighing, the cupboard \ndoor closes. Finally Kraler arrives at half past one. “Oh, dearie \nme, I see nothing but strawberries, strawberries at breakfast, \nstrawberries stewed by Miep, I smell strawberries, must have \na rest from them and go upstairs— what is being washed up \nhere . . . strawberries.” \n\nThe remainder are being bottled. In the evening: two jars \nunsealed. Daddy quickly makes them into jam The next \nmorning: two more unsealed and four in the afternoon. Van \nDaan hadn't brought them to the right temperature for steril- \nizing. Now Daddy makes jam every evening. \n\nWe eat strawberries with our porridge, skimmed milk with \nstrawberries, bread and butter with strawberries, strawberries \nfor dessert, strawberries with sugar, strawberries with sand. \nFor two whole days strawberries and nothing but strawberries, \nthen the supply was finished or in bottles and under lock and \nkey. \n\n\"I say, Anne,” Margot calls out, \"the greengrocer on the \ncorner has let us have some green peas, nineteen pounds,\" \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 229 \n\n“That's nice of him/' I replied. And it certainly is, but oh, the \nwork . . . ugh! \n\n“You've all got to help shelling peas on Saturday morning,” \nMummy announced when we were at table. And, sure enough, \nthe big enamel pan duly appeared this morning, filled to the \nbrim. Shelling peas is a boring job, but you ought to try \n“skinning\" the pods. I don't think many people realize how \nsoft and tasty the pod is when the skin on the inside has been \nremoved. However, an even greater advantage is that the \nquantity which can be eaten is about triple the amount of \nwhen one only eats the peas. It's an exceptionally precise, \nfinicky job, pulling out this skin; perhaps it's all right for \npedantic dentists or precise office workers, but for an impa- \ntient teen-ager like me, it’s frightful. We began at half past \nmne, I got up at half past ten, at half past eleven I sat down \nagain. This refrain hummed in my ears: bend the top, pull the \nskm, remove the string, throw out the pod, etc., etc., they \ndance before my eyes, green, green, green maggots, strings, \nrotten pods, green, green, green. Just for the sake of doing \nsomething, I chatter the whole morning, any nonsense that \ncomes into my head, make everyone laugh, and bore them \nstiff. But every string that I pull makes me feel more certain \nthat I never, never want to be just a housewife only! \n\nWe finally have breakfast at twelve o'clock, but from half \npast twelve until quarter past one we've got to go skinning \npods again. I’m just about seasick when I stop, the others a \nbit too. I go and sleep till four o’clock, but I'm still upset by \nthose wretched peas. \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Saturday , 15 July , 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\nWe have had a book from the library with the challenging \ntitle of: What Do You Think of the Modem Young Girl? I \nwant to talk about this subject today. \n\nThe author of this book criticizes “the youth of today” from \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n230 \n\n\ntop to toe, without, however, condemning the whole of the \nyoung brigade as \"incapable of anything good/’ On the con- \ntrary, she is rather of the opinion that if young people wished, \nthey have it in their hands to make a bigger, more beautiful \nand better world, but that they occupy themselves with su- \nperficial things, without giving a thought to real beauty. \n\nIn some passages, the writer gave me very much the feeling \nshe was directing her criticism at me, and that’s why I want \nto lay myself completely bare to you for once and defend my- \nself against this attack. \n\nI have one outstanding trait in my character, which must \nstrike anyone who knows me for any length of time, and that \nis my knowledge of myself. I can watch myself and my ac- \ntions, just like an outsider. The Anne of every day I can face \nentirely without prejudice, without making excuses for her, \nand watch what’s good and what’s bad about her. This \"self- \nconsciousness” haunts me, and every time I open my mouth I \nknow as soon as I’ve spoken whether \"that ought to have been \ndifferent” or \"that was right as it was.” There are so many \nthings about myself that I condemn; I couldn’t begin to name \nthem all. I understand more and more how true Daddy’s \nwords were when he said: \"All children must look after their \nown upbringing.” Parents can only give good advice or put \nthem on the right paths, but the final forming of a person’s \ncharacter lies in their own hands. \n\nIn addition to this, I have lots of courage, I always feel so \nstrong and as if I can bear a great deal, I feel so free and so \nyoung! I was glad when I first realized it, because I don’t think \nI shall easily bow down before the blows that inevitably come \nto everyone. \n\nBut I’ve talked about these things so often before. Now I \nwant to come to the chapter of \"Daddy and Mummy don’t \nunderstand me.” Daddy and Mummy have always thoroughly \nspoiled me, were sweet to me, defended me, and have done all \nthat parents could do. And yet I’ve felt so terribly lonely for a \nlong time, so left out, neglected, and misunderstood. Daddy \ntried all he could to check my rebellious spirit, but it was no \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 231 \n\nuse, I have cured myself, by seeing for myself what was wrong \nin my behavior and keeping it before my eyes. \n\nHow is it that Daddy was never any support to me in my \nstruggle, why did he completely miss the mark when he \nwanted to offer me a helping hand? Daddy tried the wrong \nmethods, he always talked to me as a child who was going \nthrough difficult phases. It sounds crazy, because Daddy’s the \nonly one who has always taken me into his confidence, and \nno one but Daddy has given me the feeling that I’m sensible. \nBut there’s one thing he’s omitted: you see, he hasn’t realized \nthat for me the fight to get on top was more important than all \nelse. I didn’t want to hear about “symptoms of your age,” or \n“other girls,” or “it wears off by itself”; I didn’t want to be \ntreated as a girl-like-all-others, but as Anne-on-her-own-merits. \nPirn didn’t understand that. For that matter, I can’t confide in \nanyone, unless they tell me a lot about themselves, and as I \nknow very little about Pirn, I don’t feel that I can tread upon \nmore intimate ground with him. Pirn always takes up the \nolder, fatherly attitude, tells me that he too has had similar \npassing tendencies. But still he’s not able to feel with me like \na friend, however hard he tries. These things have made me \nnever mention my views on life nor my well-considered \ntheories to anyone but my diary and, occasionally, to Margot. \nI concealed from Daddy everything that perturbed me; I \nnever shared my ideals with him. I was aware of the fact that \nI was pushing him away from me. \n\nI couldn’t do anything else. I have acted entirely according \nto my feelings, but I have acted in the way that was best for \nmy peace of mind. Because I should completely lose my re- \npose and self-confidence, which I have built up so shakily, if, \nat this stage, I were to accept criticisms of my half-completed \ntask. And I can’t do that even from Pim, although it sounds \nvery hard, for not only have I not shared my secret thoughts \nwith Pim but I have often pushed him even further from me, \nby my irritability. \n\nThis is a point that I think a lot about: why is it that Pim \nannoys me? So much so that I can hardly bear him teaching \nme, that his affectionate ways strike me as being put on, that \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n232 \n\n\nI want to be left in peace and would really prefer it if he \ndropped me a bit, until I felt more certain in my attitude to- \nwards him. Because I still have a gnawing feeling of guilt over \nthat horrible letter that I dared to write him when I was so \nwound up. Oh, how hard it is to be really strong and brave in \nevery way! \n\nYet this was not my greatest disappointment; no, I ponder \nfar more over Peter than Daddy. I know very well that I con- \nquered him instead of he conquering me. I created an image \nof him in my mind, pictured him as a quiet, sensitive, lovable \nboy, who needed affection and friendship. I needed a living \nperson to whom I could pour out my heart; I wanted a friend \nwho’d help to put me on the right road. I achieved what I \nwanted, and slowly but surely, I drew him towards me. Final- \nly, when I had made him feel friendly, it automatically de- \nveloped into an intimacy which, on second thought, I don’t \nthink I ought to have allowed. \n\nWe talked about the most private things, and yet up till \nnow we have never touched on those things that filled, and \nstill fill, my heart and soul. I still don’t know quite what to \nmake of Peter, is he superficial, or does he still feel shy, even \nof me? But dropping that, I committed one error m my desire \nto make a real friendship: I switched over and tried to get at \nhim by developmg it into a more intimate relation, whereas I \nshould have explored all other possibilities. He longs to be \nloved and I can see that he’s beginning to be more and more \nin love with me. He gets satisfaction out of our meetings, \nwhereas they just have the effect of making me want to try it \nout with him again. And yet I don’t seem able to touch on the \nsubjects that I’m so longing to bring out into the daylight. I \ndrew Peter towards me, far more than he realizes. Now he \nclings to me, and for the time being, I don’t see any way of \nshaking him off and putting him on his own feet. When I \nrealized that he could not be a friend for my understanding, I \nthought I would at least try to lift him up out of his narrow- \nmindedness and make him do something with his youth. \n\n“For m its innermost depths youth is lonelier than old age.” \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n233 \n\n\nI read this saying in some book and I’ve always remembered \nit, and found it to be true. Is it true then that grownups have \na more difficult time here than we do? No. I know it isn’t. \nOlder people have formed their opinions about everything, \nand don’t waver before they act. It’s twice as hard for us \nyoung ones to hold our ground, and maintain our opinions, in \na time when all ideals are being shattered and destroyed, \nwhen people are showing their worst side, and do not know \nwhether to believe in truth and right and God. \n\nAnyone who claims that the older ones have a more difficult \ntime here certainly doesn’t realize to what extent our problems \nweigh down on us, problems for which we axe probably much \ntoo young, but which thrust themselves upon us continually, \nuntil, after a long time, we think weve found a solution, but \nthe solution doesn’t seem able to resist the facts which reduce \nit to nothing again. That’s the difficulty in these times: ideals, \ndreams, and cherished hopes rise within us, only to meet the \nhorrible truth and be shattered. \n\nIt’s really a wonder that I haven’t dropped all my ideals, \nbecause they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet \nI keep them, because m spite of everything I still believe that \npeople are really good at heart. I simply can’t build up my \nhopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and \ndeath. I see the world gradually being turned into a wilder- \nness, I hear the ever approaching thunder, which will destroy \nus too, I can feel the sufferings of millions and yet, if I look up \ninto the heavens, I think that it will all come right, that this \ncruelty too will end, and that peace and tranquillity will re- \nturn again. \n\nIn the meantime, I must uphold my ideals, for perhaps the \ntime will come when I shall be able to carry them out. \n\nYours, Anne",

Yes, really, they re going well! Super news! An at- \ntempt has been made on Hitler's life and not even by Jewish \ncommunists or English capitalists this time, but by a proud \nGerman general, and what's more, he's a count, and still quite \nyoung. The Fuhrer's life was saved by Divine Providence and, \nunfortunately, he managed to get off with just a few scratches \nand burns. A few officers and generals who were with him \nhave been killed and wounded. The chief culprit was shot. \n\nAnyway, it certainly shows that there are lots of officers and \ngenerals who are sick of the war and would like to see Hitler \ndescend into a bottomless pit. When they’ve disposed of Hit- \nler, their aim is to establish a military dictator, who will make \npeace with the Allies, then they intend to rearm and start an- \nother wax in about twenty years' time. Perhaps the Divine \nPower tarried on purpose in getting him out of the way, be- \ncause it would be much easier and more advantageous to the \nAllies if the impeccable Germans kill each other off; it'll make \nless work for the Russians and the English and they'll be able \nto begin rebuilding their own towns all the sooner. \n\nBut still, were not that far yet, and I don't want to antici- \npate the glorious events too soon. Still, you must have noticed, \nthis is all sober reality and that I'm in quite a matter-of-fact \nmood today; for once, I’m not jabbering about high ideals. \nAnd what's more, Hitler has even been so kind as to announce \nto his faithful, devoted people that from now on everyone in \nthe armed forces must obey the Gestapo, and that any soldier \nwho knows that one of his superiors was involved in this low, \ncowardly attempt upon his life may shoot the same on the \nspot, without court-martial. \n\nWhat a perfect shambles it's going to be. Little Johnnie's \nfeet begin hurting him during a long march, he’s snapped at \nby his boss, the officer, Johnnie grabs his rifle and cries out: \n\"You wanted to murder the Fiihrer, so there's your reward,” \nOne bang and the proud chief who dared to tick off little \nJohnnie has passed into eternal life (or is it eternal death?). \nIn the end, whenever an officer finds himself up against a \nsoldier, or having to take the lead, he'll be wetting his pants \nfrom anxiety, because the soldiers will dare to say more than \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n235 \n\n\nthey do. Do you gather a bit what I mean, or have I been \nskipping too much from one subject to another? I can’t help \nit, the prospect that I may be sitting on school benches next \nOctober makes me feel far too cheerful to be logical! Oh, \ndearie me, hadn’t I just told you that I didn’t want to be too \nhopeful? Forgive me, they haven’t given me the name “little \nbundle of contradictions” all for nothing! \n\nYours, Anne",

        "original_text": "Tuesday , 1 August, 1944 \n\n\nDear Kitty, \n\n“Little bundle of contradictions.” That’s how I ended my \nlast letter and that’s how I’m going to begin this one. “A little \nbundle of contradictions,” can you tell me exactly what it is? \nWhat does contradiction mean? Like so many words, it can \nmean two things, contradiction from without and contradic- \ntion from within. \n\nThe first is the ordinary “not giving in easily, always know- \ning best, getting in the last word,” enfin, all the unpleasant \nqualities for which I’m renowned. The second nobody knows \nabout, that’s my own secret. \n\nI’ve already told you before that I have, as it were, a dual \npersonality One half embodies my exuberant cheerfulness, \nmaking fun of everything, my high-spiritedness, and above all, \nthe way I take everything light. This includes not taking \noffense at a flirtation, a kiss, an embrace, a dirty joke. This \nside is usually lying in wait and pushes away the other which \nis much better, deeper and purer. You must realize that no \none knows Anne’s better side and that’s why most people find \nme so insufferable. \n\nCertainly I’m a giddy clown for one afternoon, but then \neveryone’s had enough of me for another month. Really, it’s \njust the same as a love film is for deep-thinking people, simply \na diversion, amusing just for once, something which is soon \nforgotten, not bad, but certainly not good. I loathe having to \ntell you this, but why shouldn’t I, if I know it’s true anyway? \n\n\n\nANNE FRANK \n\n\n236 \n\n\nMy lighter superficial side will always be too quick for the \ndeeper side of me and that’s why it will always win. You can’t \nimagine how often I’ve already tried to push this Anne away, \nto cripple her, to hide her, because after all, she’s only half of \nwhat’s called Anne: but it doesn’t work and I know, too, why \nit doesn’t work. \n\nI’m awfully scared that everyone who knows me as I always \nam will discover that I have another side, a finer and better \nside. I’m afraid they’ll laugh at me, think I’m ridiculous and \nsentimental, not take me seriously. I’m used to not being taken \nseriously but it’s only the ‘lighthearted” Anne that’s used to it \nand can bear it; the “deeper” Anne is too frail for it. Some- \ntimes, if I really compel the good Anne to take the stage for a \nquarter of an hour, she simply shrivels up as soon as she has to \nspeak, and lets Anne number one take over, and before I real- \nize it, she has disappeared. \n\nTherefore, the nice Anne is never present in company, has \nnot appeared one single time so far, but almost always pre- \ndominates when were alone. I know exactly how I’d like to \nbe, how I am too . . . inside. But, alas, I’m only like that for \nmyself. And perhaps that’s why, no, I’m sure it’s the reason \nwhy I say I’ve got a happy nature within and why other peo- \nple think I’ve got a happy nature without. I am guided by the \npure Anne within, but outside I’m nothing but a frolicsome \nlittle goat who’s broken loose. \n\nAs I’ve already said, I never utter my real feelings about \nanything and that’s how I’ve acquired the name of chaser- \nafter-boys, flirt, know-all, reader of love stories. The cheerful \nAnne laughs about it, gives cheeky answers, shrugs her shoul- \nders indifferently, behaves as if she doesn’t care, but, oh \ndearie me, the quiet Anne’s reactions are just the opposite. If \nI’m to be quite honest, then I must admit that it does hurt me, \nthat I try terribly hard to change myself, but that I’m always \nfighting against a more powerful enemy. \n\nA voice sobs within me: “There you are, that’s what’s be- \ncome of you: you’re uncharitable, you look supercilious and \npeevish, people dislike you and all because you won’t listen to \nthe advice given you by your own better hah.” Oh, I would \n\n\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n\n237 \n\n\nlike to listen, but it doesn’t work; if I’m quiet and serious, \neveryone thinks it’s a new comedy and then I have to get out \nof it by turning it mto a joke, not to mention my own family, \nwho are sure to think I’m ill, make me swallow pills for head- \naches and nerves, feel my neck and my head to see whether \nI’m running a temperature, ask if I’m constipated and criticize \nme for being in a bad mood. I can’t keep that up: if I’m \nwatched to that extent, I start by getting snappy, then un- \nhappy, and finally I twist my heart round again, so that the \nbad is on the outside and the good is on the inside and keep \non trying to find a way of becoming what I would so like to \nbe, and what I could be, if . . . there weren’t any other people \nliving in the world. \n\nYours, Anne",
